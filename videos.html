<H1> Videos of talks</H1>
<P>
Some of my lectures have been recorded as videos.  Here they are, roughly
in temporal order.  In some cases the website hosting the video also has a PDF
of the lecture slides available, which will be clearer than any slides you can
see in the video.

<a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/computational-aspects-of-biological-information-workshop-session-3-2/">At Microsoft Research</a> in December, 2007 in a workshop on
&ldquo;Computational Aspects of Biological Information&rdquo;, a lecture
on &ldquo;Reconstructing Phylogenies: How? How Well? Why?,&rdquo; At the link
you will be able to access the video in two formats, the audio recording in
two formats, and the slides in two formats.
Also archived at archive.org <a href="https://archive.org/details/Microsoft_Research_Video_103861">here</a>.
If you want a clearer view of the slides,
 <a href="/media/microsoft07.pdf">here they are</a> as a PDF.</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPhgLEqiYBw">Systematics
Association Julian Huxley Lecture</a>, July 2008, auditorium of the Linnean
Society, London. Richard Bateman is in the chair.  <a href="/media/huxley.pdf">Here</a> you will also find the projection slides, as a PDF.
This talk covers the use of threshold models for
 discrete 0/1 traits and use of fossil species in model-based frameworks.</li>

<a
href="http://news.uchicago.edu/multimedia/evolutionary-trees-and-population-genetics-family-reunion">Lecture
at 500th Convocation of the University of Chicago</a>, (also available at
Youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pATY0zeijYQ">here</a>)
October, 2009 (the sound for
Marty Kreitman's introduction breaks up, but the rest of the sound is
clear).  If you want a clearer view of the projection slides, <a
href="/media/chicago.pdf">here they are</a> as a PDF.   This talk argues that
the separate lines of work on within-species molecular population genetics and
between-species molecular evolution are now merging in a major event, a Grand
Reunion.</li>
<li> At the University of California, Davis on 21 April, 2010
I gave the <a
href="https://video.ucdavis.edu/media/Storer+Lecture+-+Joesph+Felsenstein+04-21-2011/0_x1zdhwje">Storer
Lecture</a>.  Introduction by Carl Boettiger.  Coincidentally,
Tracey Storer was the author of the introductory textbook used in the
first-year zoology class I took at the University of Wisconsin
in 1960.  The PDF of the slides I use in the talk is <a href="/media/davis.pdf">here</a>.
There is a transcript of my talk also available at the video site.</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.gs.washington.edu/news/publiclecture2010.htm">Evening at
the Genome</a> lecture in Seattle on 28 July 2010 in the Genome Sciences 
Department public lecture series, on &ldquo;Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosome 
Adam: Who do your genes come from?&rdquo;&nbsp;  Video is in two parts.  For
greater clarity, <a href="/media/atthegenome.pdf">here</a> is a PDF of the slides.</li>
<li> A web talk on 24 January 2011 on the subject <a href=
"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1s7DZpxrAc">&ldquo;What poultry breeders and
guinea pigs have to tell us about statistical nonmolecular
phylogenetics&rdquo;</a>, in Erick Matsen's interesting series of talks by various
people working on phylogenies.  It is available also in
<a href="http://www.phyloseminar.org/recorded.html">its original format</a>,
which uses Java and may require too much memory on your machine.</li>
<li> Mary Kuhner interviews me in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2M76lQ0Njc">Distinguished Faculty Interview Series</a> of our department on 5 June 2012.
I ran over, which I can't say surprised anyone.
<li> The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2IKZrUzUyk">Japanese television clip</a> showing me receiving the International Prize
for Biology on 18 November 2013, making some remarks, and Joan and I greeting the Emperor and Empress.</li>
<li> I gave a talk on "A Brief History of Computational Phylogenetics" on 4
August, 2016 in Erick Matsen's "phyloseminar" series of online talks.  Video of
the talk and of the discussion on
YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PcD15i7yzJ8">here</a>. (The sound gets a little disconnected from the image in
the part at the end where you can see me talking).</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwHD5Y3W94U">Video of a lecture</a> on 27 October 2016 hosted by the Universidad Nacional
Autonoma de M&eacute;xico, on "How can phylogenies illuminate morphological
evolution?". My hosts were the Departamento de Biolog√≠a Evolutiva with
funding from the Colegio Nacional.  The introduction in Spanish by Antonio
Lazcano and the question period are not included in the video.  The
PDF of the slides will be found <a href="/media/mexico.pdf">here</a>.  An MP3
recording of the sound will be found <a href="mexico.mp3">here</a> which
includes the introduction and the question period as well.  Some of the
questions are very faint in the recording and you may have to increase the
volume to hear them.</li>
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/ZF3nIMvBBDw">Video of my 2018 Fisher Memorial
Lecture</a> which was given as part of the "PopGroup" (Population Genetics
Group) in their 51st annual meeting.  (It was almost exactly 50 years from
the date of the first PopGroup meeting, which it happens I attended).  The
audience was in Bristol, U.K.  However I was in Seattle and the talk was given
using Skype.  The video shows me and also my slides. The title was "Is there
a more fundamental theorem of natural selection?". The topic is not really
Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection, but how we might, in a 
"toy" model, connect energy, entropy, and a measure of biological
information.  The talk is introduced by the chair of the Fisher Memorial
Trust, Sir Walter Bodmer, an old friend and onetime co-author of a paper
with me.  The PDF of the slides I use is available <a
href="/media/fisherlecture.pdf">here</a>. another
place to view the lecture video is <a
href="https://natureecoevocommunity.nature.com/users/24561-richard-buggs/posts/31896-is-there-a-more-fundamental-theorem-of-natural-selection"><strong>here</strong></a>.</li>
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/UPHdmGwpYkM">Video of my talk to the North Seattle Tech Forum</a> on August 6, 2018 on
"Who your genes come from -- in the short term and in the long term".  This
is a series of talks run (partly) by my old friend Ken Berkun.  He has
posted a video of the talk.  A PDF of the projection slides will
be found <a href="/media/TechForum2018.pdf">here</a>.  I have alse
recently found that some of my calculations were done -- a few years
earlier -- by Graham Coop at the University of California, Davis.  They
will be found at his lab's blog.  Start here: <a
href="https://gcbias.org"><strong>https://gcbias.org</strong></a> and look at
his category of "genetic-genealogy" posts.  Fortunately, Graham and I
came to very similar conclusions.</li>
<li> <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UA9SVwSQ3U&list=PLCHPzwXO5rNK6K_te0AQCwOMA0k-uA9wV&index=5">Video
of my talk at the SteveFest, a symposium celebrating the retirement of Stevan
Arnold</a>, which occurred on 27 July 2019 at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon.
Not only a talk, but a performance as well.  I describe the Evolutionary
Quantitiative Genetics Workshop and how it came to be.  Here is <a href="/media/arnoldfest.pdf">a PDF</a> of my slides, including some views of Friday Harbor Labs that I
forgot to show when I lectured.</li>
 <li> A <a href="https://youtu.be/oaCinQIy8MI">
video of a conversation</a> with Casey Dunn of Yale University on 26 January
2021.  It covers my involvement with phylogenies, in particular the history and
internal structure of my PHYLIP package of progrms.  This includes a walkthrough
of the internals of Dnaml, one of those programs.  The whole thing is nearly
2 hours long and does require some background in biology and in phylogenetic
methods.</li>
<li> On August 27, 2021 I was the guest on one session of Youtuber AronRa's series 
"Matter of Fact: Science".  This involved answering questions, mostly about
 phylogenies and classifications.  The questions were asked by him and his
 colleagues who run the series, and texted questions from listeners.  Some of
 which defied comprehension.  The session was live but the recording will be
 found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNTYiLNkgfk">here</a>.</li>

<li> Lectures in the one-week summer tutorial on Evolutionary Quantitative
Genetics, given at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological
Synthesis at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, were live-streamed and
also video-recorded in the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The videos for 
these years have been posted to YouTube.  From 2017 to 2019 we ran the Workshop
 at Friday Harbor Laboratories of the University of Washington.  In 2021 we ran it as Zoom
sessions, and the videos of the lectures are available on Vimeo.
All of these include a
number of lectures by me (I was co-leader of the Tutorial).  The 2014-2016 video
is a bit strange as two cameras show images of different parts of the
front of the lecture room, and these are shown side by side, sometimes
resulting in two simultaneous images of the speaker.  In the 2016
course, I was not present in person, appearing instead by Skype on a monitor
at the front of the room.

For years 2014-2016 there are links to the web page for that year's course.  From
there you access the WordPress blog for the course which has a schedule of
lectures and pages for each lecture, with PDF or PPT slides for the lecture and
an audio recording of it as well.<br>
For the 2021 videos, start at the webpage
<a href="https://EQGW.github.io">here</a>, go to the Schedule, and there
find links to pages for the lectures, each of which has a link to the
Vimeo video for that lecture.  The discussion and computer lab sessions 
do not have videos.</li>
