<h1> Speciation programs used in 1981 paper in Evolution </h1>
<p>
These are written in Pascal, a now-rare computer language
which I found great for writing programs in that it
pressured me to not make some obvious errors.  They
  should run on Free Pascal <a href="https://www.freepascal.org/">(<tt>fpc</tt>.</a>,  
which you can download and
install on your computer.  It will also compile successfully
in most other Pascal compilers.
<p>
They are the programs used for the calculations in my
1981 paper in Evolution, "Skepticism toward Santa Rosalia:
Why are there so few kinds of animals?"
(which was not really a refutation of G. Evelyn Hutchinson's
famous paper on the determinants of the number of species,
rather it raised the issue of why the genetics of speciation
might further limit the number of species of organisms).
