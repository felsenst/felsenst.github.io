    <h1> Software from our lab </h1>
   <p>
     These are programs that are written to accompany specific papers.
     In addition, see the programs (or packages)
<ul>
<li>  PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) which is distributed <a href="https://phylipweb.github.io/phylip">here</a>.
</li>
  <li>
  LAMARC, Mary Kuhner and Jon Yamato's program for Likelihood Analysis using Monte carlo sampling with Random Coalescents.  Distributed <a href="https://lamarcweb.github.io/lamarcweb">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
  PopG, a Java program to simulate evolution at one locus with two alleles.  Written by Ben Zawadzki and Jim McGill, and descended from earlier versions in other languages starting in the 1970s.
  For use in teaching population genetics. Distributed <a href="https://felsenst.github.io/popg/popg.html">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li> Threshml, a program to carry out the MCMC method for both continuous and discrete 
  characters comparative method, described in my 2012 paper in American Naturalist.  Can be found 
  <a href="https://phylipweb.github.io/phylip/tree/main/download/threshml/index.html">here</a> 
  and downloaded from there.

  <h2> Two locus iteration of gene frequencies, linkage disequilibrium with two linked interacting loci </h2>
<P>
  <p>
C program that reads  from a file a 3x3 blank-separated matrix of fitnesses for two alleles at two loci, plus recombination fraction and starting gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium, and
allows you to iterate generations and see whether mean fitnesses are increasing or decreasing in each generation
