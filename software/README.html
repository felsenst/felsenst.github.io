  <h2> Two locus iteration of gene frequencies, linkage disequilibrium with two linked interacting loci </h2>
<P>
  <p>
C program that reads  from a file a 3x3 blank-separated matrix of fitnesses for two alleles at two loci, plus recombination fraction and starting gene frequencies and linkage disequilibrium, and
allows you to iterate generations and see whether mean fitnesses are increasing or decreasing in each generation
