This is a FORTRAN II program that I wrote in 1966 to infer a tree using Camin-Sokal parsimony with characters that had "character state trees".
It read in a data set that included a set of character state trees, where there could be up to 9 states (0 to 8) with state 9 being the "unknown"
state.  I sent the original program to Bob Sokal and Jim Rohlf and they reported that it ran faster than their program.   That is not surprising
since their program wrote out information to disk or tape and then read it back in.
<p>
This program is not the original version but is the program after a little development.  It uses standard FORTRAN II but also uses a
nonstandard operation (&amp;) which is a bitwise AND of the bits in two integers.  That was available in the FORTRAN II compiler
for the IBM 7094 at the University of Chicago.
