<h1> TAX01 </h1>
<p>
This is a clustering program I wrote in late 1964 or early 1965.  I was in the Department of Zoology of the University 
of Chicago, as a graduate student in Dick Lewontin's lab who liked to mess with computers.  Jack Hubby and Lynn Throckmorton
had some total-protein-banding data from electrophoresis of Drosophila species which they wanted clustered.  They lent me a 
copy of Sokal and Sneath's 1963 book "Principles of Numerical Taxonomy".  It explained many clustering methods.  I waxs
intrigued and ended up writing this agglomerative clustering program.  It was my introduction to numerical methods in
systematics.
<p>
This is not the original version but one expanded to handle character-state tree input format and multiple
clustering methods.
<p>
It was written in FORTRAN II for UC's IBM 7094.  The one nonstandard feature is the use of the ampersand character (&amp;)
to represent the nonstandard operation of a bitwise AND operation on two integers.  Watch out for that!
<p>
Later I gave this program, about 1972 or so, to Fred Allendorf so he and Fred Utter could analyze electrophoretic
allele gene frequencies to get a phylogeny of salmonid species.
