I have provided two 100-species data sets in an R-compatible format.  Both
are derived from the same simulation which evolves 10 landmarks (hence 20
coordinates) in a tree of 100 species, with size and shape changing.  The
species are named  A, AA, AB, B, BA, BB, ... with 100 species in all.  The
names are in random order but correspond to the names at the tips of the tree.
