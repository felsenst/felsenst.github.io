  JF   1.    9/29    Overview and initial topics, installing and using R

  FB   2.    10/4     Overview.  Chapter 1, emphasizing the
             variety of diagrams.  Chapter 2, "one or two variables."
               Pictures of covariance, lines that fit well,
               correlations, lines that fit badly,
               initial examples -- Wright chickens, growth series.

  FB   3.    10/6    Chapter 3. Multiple regression
               Logic of MR as path analysis
               The three main special cases (ANCOVA, growth
                 innovations, LDISC).
               Morphometric examples: Bumpus, allometry in multiple groups

  JF   4.    10/11   Quantitative genetics

  JF   5.    10/13   Brownian motion and quantitative genetics

  FB   6.    10/18   FB's Chapter 4 ("Transition to Multivariate Analysis")

               The information matrix for a bivariate Gaussian distribution
               Covariance matrix inversion and covariance matrix
                 eigenanalysis embody opposing approaches to measurement
               The Wishart distribution and its implications for PCA
               Critique of covariance matrices.  Are they real? (I.e.,
                 does the organism know about them?) Do their inverses
                 and/or their eigenanalyses have any biological meaning?

  JF   7.    10/20   Fitness surfaces, Brownian Motion and O/U model
