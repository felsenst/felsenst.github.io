  JF   1.    9/29    Overview and initial topics, installing and using R

  FB   2.    10/4     Overview.  Chapter 1, emphasizing the
               variety of diagrams.  Chapter 2, "one or two variables."
               Pictures of covariance, lines that fit well,
               correlations, lines that fit badly,
               initial examples -- Wright chickens, growth series.

  FB   3.    10/6    Chapter 3. Multiple regression
               Logic of MR as path analysis
               The three main special cases (ANCOVA, growth
                 innovations, LDISC).
               Morphometric examples: Bumpus, allometry in multiple groups

  FB   4.    10/11  Introduction to GMM: how to keep your place in an anatomy.
             (Chapter 5.1.)

  FB   5.    10/13   Methods for landmarks three at a time. Tensors;
                uniform term.  (Chapter 5.2.)

  FB   6.    10/18   FB's Chapter 4 ("Transition to Multivariate Analysis")
               The information matrix for a bivariate Gaussian distribution
               Covariance matrix inversion and covariance matrix
                 eigenanalysis embody opposing approaches to measurement
               The Wishart distribution and its implications for PCA
               Critique of covariance matrices.  Are they real? (I.e.,
                 does the organism know about them?) Do their inverses
                 and/or their eigenanalyses have any biological meaning?

  FB   7.    10/21   Chapter 4 material, continued (see above)

  FB   8.    10/25  Procrustes approaches and the relative warps  Chap. 5.3-5.4.
               Principal coordinates of shape; of size-shape.
               The critique of shape space as non-biological
               The critique of Procrustes distance as enforcing
                 unrealistic symmetries.
