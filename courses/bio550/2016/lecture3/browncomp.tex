\bigskip

Can we compute transition probabilities for genetic models such as the
Wright-Fisher model? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Can we do this analytically? {\bf No.} (although the right eigenvectors and 
the eigenvalues are known) the full set of left eigenvalues has never been derived.
\item We can take such a model for a given (not-too-big) population size $~\mathsf{N}~$ and compute the transition probability matrix, then either power it
up numerically or get its eigenvalues and eigenvectors
\item OK, what about the diffusion approximation.  Aren't they very close
approximations?  Yes, they and Kimura (1955a, 1955b) derived transition 
probabilities for the diffusion process as sums of series in Gegenbaur 
polynomials. {\bf But} they are difficult to work with.

The expectation of gene frequency change in one generation (under pure genetic 
drift without mutation) is zero.  The variance is the binomial variance
\[
\mathsf{\expect\left[\left(\Delta p \right)^2\right] \ = \ \frac{p(1-p)}{2N_e}}
\]
\bigskip

That variance is not constant: it varies with $~\mathsf{p}~$ (in a parabola), but maybe we can roughly
approximate it by dealing with the case where all populations have roughly
similar gene frequencies, so the variances are nearly the same.  Maybe.  Roughly.

%\begin{slide}[Replace]{The arc-sine square-root transform}
%\bigskip
%
%Can't we use the arc-sine square-root transform to homogenize the variance of
%the change in gene frequency?
%\bigskip
%
%Approximately, when $~\mathsf{N}~$ is large.
%\bigskip
%
%It involves following the transformed variable
%\[
%\mathsf{y \ = \ \sin^{-1} \left(\sqrt{p} \right)}
%\]
%
%A ``delta-method'' approximation (basically, the Taylor series) does get
%the standard result for one generation:
%\[
%\mathsf{~\Var(\Delta y) \ \simeq  \frac{1}{8N}}
%\]
%
%\end{slide}
%
%\begin{slide}[Replace]{Trouble in paradise? }
%\bigskip
%
%Taking the Taylor series in $~\mathsf{\Delta y}$, and taking expectations,
%we find that the first term in $\mathsf{~(p-p_0)~}$ is zero, but the second term gives
%\[
%\mathsf{\expect[\Delta y ] \ \simeq \ \expect[\left(p - p_0\right)^2] \frac{2p_0 - 1}{\left(p_0(1-p_0)\right)^{3/2}}}
%\]
%
%and substituting the formulas for variance of gene frequency change this becomes
%\[
%\mathsf{\expect[\Delta y] \ \simeq \ \frac{1}{8N} \frac{2p_0 - 1}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)}}}
%\]
%so there is a directional pressure away from gene frequency $~\mathsf{1/2}$: $~\mathsf{y}~$ is not very well approximated by Brownian Motion.
%\bigskip
%
%So we need the approximation that the gene frequencies are fairly
%similar; this breaks down as they approach 0 or 1.
%
%\end{slide}
%

\begin{slide}[Replace]{What about a quantitative character? }
\bigskip

If a quantitative character is a sum of contributions from a number of loci,
then if the individual locus gene frequencies have their change approximated
by Brownian Motion, the linear combination will also change by Brownian motion.
This works for multiple alleles.
\bigskip

\begin{itemize}
\item if there is any dominance, there will
be some nonlinearity and the approximation will be less good.
\item Epistasis can cause even more trouble.
\end{itemize}

First discussed by me (Felsenstein, 1973).

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[Replace]{But, if there are mutations making incremental changes .. }
\bigskip

\centerline{\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{mutationscale.idraw}}
\bigskip

... as we saw with the discussion of quantitative characters, if a relatively
constant genetic variance is maintained, and mutations have additive
effects, then
genetic drift will cause the mean to change in a random walk close to Brownian Motion.
\bigskip

{\it However}, if one approaches some limit where most
mutations oppose movement to it, and there are
no mutations allowing you to go past that limit, this approximation
will be poor.

\end{slide}

%\begin{slide}[Replace]{Variable selection as a cause of Brownian Motion }
%\bigskip
%
%I suggested (Felsenstein, 1973) that another cause for Brownian Motion
%would be variable selection, where the selection coefficients change
%through time in a random way (themselves approximating a Brownian Motion).
%\bigskip
%
%Issues with this include:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The variance of selection coefficients might differ from locus to
%locus
%\item Selection might actually be on the whole character value, rather than
%locus by locus
%\end{itemize}
%
%\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[Replace]{Brownian motion is mathematically tractable}
\bigskip

You can easily compute transition probabilities from one value to 
another, since the net change after ``time'' $\ \mathsf{t}\ $ is normal. with
mean zero and variance $\ \mathsf{\sigma^2 t} \ $,  and changes in successive
time intervals are independent.
\bigskip

When two lineages share a period of common ancestry, the resulting tip species
have phenotypes that covary, the covariance being the variance expected during
their shared ancestry.

% Yes.
% \bigskip

% You can easily compute transition probabilities from one value to another.

\begin{slide}[Replace]{Covarying character change along a lineage}
\bigskip

What is the distribution of changes in multiple characters (say $\mathsf{p}$
of them) along a lineage?   Simply the appropriate multiple of the
infinitesimal rate of change per unit branch length.
\bigskip

If a set of characters $~\mathsf{\bf x}~$, changes under covarying Brownian 
motion, in time $~\mathsf{t}~$ (or a pseudo-time branch-length $~\mathsf{t}~$ 
) the change will be distributed as

\[
\mathsf{\bf {\Delta x} \ \sim \  {\cal N} (\bf 0, {\bf V}t)},
\]

(where $~\mathsf{\bf V}~$ is the covariance matrix of the infinitesimal change 
of the Brownian Motion).

% Consider change of two characters, each assessed in a different species.  Say
% character $~\mathsf{x}~$ and character $~\mathsf{y}$, the first measured

%Given that changes in different branches are independent (whether changes of
%the same character or of different characters), the only nonzero covariance
%is between $~\mathsf{\Delta x_1}~$ and $~\mathsf{\Delta y_1}.$
%
%\[

%$~\mathsf{\ell}~$ in species $~\mathsf{j}$, the covariance between them is
%\[
%\mathsf{Cov [x_{ik}, x_{j\ell}] \ = \ t_{ij}\;v_{k\ell}}

\begin{slide}[Replace]{What causes change in quantitative characters? }
\bigskip

For neutral mutation and genetic drift, can show that for a quantitative
character with additive genetic variance $~\mathsf{V_A}~$ and population size $\mathsf{~N~}$
the genetic (additive) value of the population mean is:
\bigskip

\[
\mathsf{\Var (\Delta \bar{g}) \ = \ V_A / N}
\]
\bigskip

If mutation and drift are at equilibrium:
\[
\mathsf{\expect\left[V_A^{(t+1)}\right] \ = \ V_A^{(t)} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2N}\right) + V_M}
\]
\bigskip

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[Replace]{In neutral traits additive genetic variance rules}
\bigskip

so that
\[
\mathsf{\expect\left[V_A\right] \ = \ 2N V_M}
\]

whereby
\[
\mathsf{\Var[\Delta {\bar g}] \ = \ \left(2N V_M \right) / N  \ = \  2 V_M}
\]

an analog of Kimura's result for neutral mutation.
\bigskip

Thus to transform characters to independent Brownian motions of equal
evolutionary variance, we could use the additive genetic variance $\mathsf{V_A}$.

\end{slide}

\begin{itemize}
\item We might hope to infer additive genetic covariances by doing quantitive
genetics breeding experiments to infer them from covariances among relatives,
perhaps even in multiple species.
\item Infer the covariances of the changes along the phylogeny.
\item From them, back-calculate the selective covariances.
\item The genetic covariances may also be inferrable from differences between
nearby tips on the tree if we do not have breeding experiments.
\item There is little or no hope of inferring ``selective correlations''
more directly without a complete understanding of the functional ecology.

% Brownian motion for time $~\mathsf{t}~$ has expectation zero and variance

\bigskip

One can take two neighboring tips, and consider their difference $\ \mathsf{x_1 -
x_2\ }$ as well as a weighted average $\ \mathsf{a x_1 + (1-a) x_2}$.  Using
  weights $\mathsf{a\, :\, 1-a \ = \  1/v_1\, :\, 1 /v_2}$, the weighted average is
independent of the difference, and the difference is also independent of the
rest of the tree.
\bigskip

In fact, this weighted average behaves like a tip:  Its covariances with
the other species are the same as those of $\mathsf{x_1}$ and $\mathsf{x_2}$.
It acts just as if the tree were pruned, cutting off species 1 and 2, leaving
a single species whose variance is a bit bigger.
\bigskip

\[
\mathsf{\Var[a x_1 + (1-a) x_2] \ = \  v_8 + v_9 + \frac{v_1 v_2}{v_1 + v_2}}

so in effect, a small extra amount of branch length is added.
