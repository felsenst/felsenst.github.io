Fig. 1. The interspecific allometric equation (specific regression, identified as IA) and the independent contrasts equation (identified as IC) plotted for 105 primate species in raw data space, transformed to natural logarithms. The interspecific allometric equation is ln y = 0.139 + 0.080 (ln x), with r = 0.53. The phylogenetically corrected form of this equation, taken from the independent contrasts analysis, is ln y = 0.160+0.056 (ln x), with r = 0.26.  The two equations are not significantly different from each other. The identified species are Mandrillus sphinx (M), Pongo pygmaeus (O), Gorilla gorilla (G), Pan troglodytes (P), and Homo sapiens (H).
