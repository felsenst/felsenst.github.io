\begin{slide}[Replace]{Questions to answer on back of mark-sense sheet}

On the back of the mark-sense sheet, not on the yellow comment sheets
answer the following questions.  Use a scale of A-G with A meaning

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
\item The textbook was good.
\item The homeworks were helpful.
\item Ken Karol's lecture was good.
\item Mary Kuhner's lecture was good.
\item It would have been helpful to spend more time showing examples of
data sets and their analysis rather than discussing theoretical properties
of methods.
\item Joe should have relied less on the projections and spoken more
informally.
\end{enumerate}
