For next time:
   lecture 1:  More on weighted parsimony, how it works,
               successive weighting, nonsuccessive weighting
               A more real data example of successive and nonsuccessive wtg
   lecture 2:  need slides for the compatibility test
               maybe a figure with a tree, characters that are and are
                not compatible with it, count of them vs. parsimony
               maybe use the Horses data and show data and matrix
   lecture 3:  derivation for 0/1 consistency has a jump of some equations
                (where compare two least frequent)
               maybe a slide of flow of steps in Hendy/Penny inconsistency
