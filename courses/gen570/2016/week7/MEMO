   In Bayesian lecture
     mention cancellation of denominators in Bayesian MCMC page
     have some coverage of clade probabilities, how summarize trees
     put reversibility page just after "proof" of MCMC working
     after Mau and Newton, put the primates example tree
   In likelihood ratio test
     Figure showing test in a 2-d contour plot
     Model selection: better numerical example.  Explain arrow thicknesses
     Animate the topology-test figure to show significant against v=0, but
       doubt about whether significant against best other tree
     Goldman's test: annotate arrow "to infer actual distribution"
   Bootstraps
     need panel on block-bootstrap 
     need panel on bootstrap bias correction (biascorrect1, biascorrect2)
     mention danger of multiple-tests?
     need better examples.  Use ML on same model, same data set in all 3
