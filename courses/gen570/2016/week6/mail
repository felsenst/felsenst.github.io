Hello,
	I would like to take your Genetics 570 course this spring,
pass-fail. Would you be willing to do that? You can count on me to
attend class regularly and complete all exercises and exams.

Thanks,

I'd rather not have some students taking it pass-fail.  I assure you that
I am not a tough grader.

Dr Felsenstein,
I am registered for your class next quarter, but I will be at a
departmental retreat on Monday. I will be there on Wednesday. I would also
like a copy of the book if you "take orders" during Monday's lecture.
Thanks,
Christina

Dear Joe,

I am a student in your class. Last week, I want to buy your book in Friday. 
Because I had not arranged my schedule well, I had to do an important 
experiment of mine at 12:00, so missed your class. Can I still buy your 
book next monday? Wish to get your reply. Sorry for this inconvinence 
caused by me. Thanks a lot.

You schedule it.

Yes, sure.  Perhaps at some cafeteria so I can get lunch too.

Well, you can but we've sold all the textbooks.  You'll have to make an
