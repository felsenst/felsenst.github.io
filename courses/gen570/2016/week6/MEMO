Changes:
   Restriction sites etc.:
     Need a diagram of AFLP, RAPDS
     Need more diagrams of microsatellite change methods
   Likelihood:  "support", rows (hypotheses) vs. columns (data outcomes)
   More figures on branch length iteration
   Need more discussion of analogy with pruning algorithm
   Need example of HMM use (I used fifteen.dna and an HMM)
