To add or change:
    lecture 1:
       maybe shots of first pages of the major papers
        Sokal and Sneath 1963 book
        Edwards and Cavalli-Sforza 1964, 1965; also 1963 abstract ["nett"]
        Camin and Sokal 1965
        Fitch and Margoliash paper
        Atlas of protein sequences 1967-1968
        Eck and Dayhoff 1966: maybe a figure
       Farris and Kluge refs  1969 (2); 1970  (under their pictures?)
       Hennig's book 1966;  maybe a tree with bars, a classification/tree 
       Refs to recent papers disputing: Farris 1981, a sample of
         later papers in Cladistics
     lecture 2:
       Re-examine order of figure in least squares
         equations for 5-species case are too early
       use Sarich as a data example there, show tree earlier
       show equations for weights  1/D_{ij}^2
       a little more on slide for statistical justification of LS
       Jukes-Cantor transition probability: explain no-events Poisson formula
         also a figure to explain the two systems of events
         a note on why the last event erases all others
       Jukes-Cantor distance: put the distance formula after curve
       colors in UPGMA matrices?
       show tree as it is gradually revealed, strip-tease style
       a figure for minimum evolution, flow of method?
