<STRONG> News about the course </STRONG>
<P>
These news items have the newest ones last.
<UL>
<li> Today I will collect names of those who want to order a printed copy
of the textbook (see the Syllabus for a description of it). Cost will be
in the vicinity of $28, and copies should be available Monday.  A link to
a downloadble PDF of the textbook will be found in the Syllabus.
<li> Homework 1 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 13 January.
<li> The text was printed and sold for $42.  No more copies are available.
However if you want to print your own, you can.  If you take the PDF to a copy
shop and have them printed, it might help to have some other people join you in
the order, to get a volume discount.  I am happy to assure the people at the
copy shop that I am the copyright owner and that this is OK with me.
<li> Homework 2 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 19 January.
<li> Homework 3 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 25 January.
<li> Homework 4 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 1 February.
<li> Homework 5 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 8 February.
<li> Homework 6 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 15 February.
<li> Homework 7 is now posted (see above link).  It is due 22 February.
<li> Homework 8 is now posted (see above link).  It is due on the 1st of March.
<li> Homework 9 is now posted (see above link).  It is due on the 8th of March.
<li> Homework 9 has been graded.  Course point totals have been computed and
grades assigned and posted to the UW system.  The totals and the grades have been written on the homeworks.
They will be put in the mail to you tomorrow (3/14).  A totals distribution with some
indication of grades has been posted here as a PDF <a

<A HREF="http://felsenst.github.io/courses/gs562/2017/pgbook.html">
The course text (as a PDF)</A>, <EM>Theoretical Evolutionary Genetics</EM> by Joe
Felsenstein.
(An early 2015 version is the one currently available there.  Some corrections
will be made in a few days but it is almost at the 2015 version.)
This course text will also be reproduced locally and sold to students
at cost (at a cost of about $27, I said here, but it turned out to be $42).  Students who want new printed copies should commit at the
second class session to
buy them.  If you can't make the second class session and want to be signed up

<a name="materials"><b>Lecture materials (audio recordings, etc.)</b>
<P>
The derivations will mostly be done on the whiteboard, not on lecture
projections (with a few exceptions, mostly of figures from tbe course
text).   The derivations are shown step-by-step in the text.
<p>
For the use of people who cannot make it to a lecture, WMA and MP3 audio files 
of the lectures will be linked here (as they are given).  You should be able
to use these together with the appropriate pages of the book to get some
sense of what was done in the lecture.  The files are recorded at medium
quality, and are about 9 Mb in size.   Their names indicate the date:
the files for the lecture for January 5, 2017 will be called 20170105.WMA
and 20170105.mp3.  As the recordings are made and posted here these names
will become links to the files.

From upper campus, come across the 
pedestrian bridge (over Pacific Avenue) next to Kincaid Hall (the bridge 
nearest 15th avenue).  At the south end of the bridge, descend the stairs
one level, then turn right and walk back to the street.  Go left
along the sidewalk unto you reach 15th avenue at the corner.  You can reach
Foege South by going left on 15th avenue.
<P>
Alternatively, you can reach this point by coming down 15th avenue and across
Pacific Street.
<p>
Foege (&ldquo;FAY-gee&rdquo;) Building is on your left.  Proceed to
the downhill half, turn left on the walkway between the North and South parts
of Foege Building.
Enter it at the door which is on the right side of that sidewalk after
you pass under the connection between these two parts of Foege Building.
S110 is the first room on your left as you go along this 1st 
floor corridor.

confuse everyone as to where the building is.  Notice where the little pointer tip is

<P>
<a name="othercourses"> <STRONG> What are some other related courses?</STRONG>
<P>
<P>
The UW has great strength is evolutionary genetics and statistical genetics.
Some relevant courses are:
<DL>
<DT> <b>Biology 354</b>
<DD> The main evolution course at the University, taught last Autumn quarter by
Jon Herron, who is author of a major evolution textbook, and last Spring
quarter by Carl Bergstrom, a major researcher in evolutionary genetics (and
on information networks in science). 
I believe that it will also be taught in Autumn and Spring quarters but it is
not yet announced who will be teaching it.
<DT> <b>Genome 453</b> <em>(Evolutionary Genetics)</em>
<DD> This is an
undergraduate-level course on evolution and genetics.  Given every
Autumn, it overlaps somewhat with Biology 354 but
covers the genetic aspects of evolution with less emphasis on
ecology and paleontology than the first, less emphasis on molecular
evolution than the second.  In even-numbered years the course is given by
Mary Kuhner.  It was formerly given by me in odd-numbered years.
<i>It should be understood that this is basically an undergraduate course.</i>
<dt> <b>Biology 550</b> <em>(Evolution and Systematics Seminar)</em>
<DD> Weekly seminar (&ldquo;EvolSyst&rdquo;) run
Autumn, Winter and Spring by the inimitable Toby Bradshaw.  Discussion
of many topics in evolution, with presentations by the participants.
Its course mailing list postings can be publicly viewed (search for
EvolSyst on the UW mailing list system).  Fridays at 1:30,
this quarter in Hitchcock 320.  Every quarter during the regular academic year.
<DT> <b>Statistics/Biostatistics 550-551-552</b>
<DD>The core course series for the UW's outstanding Statistical Genetics
program.  The three courses are:
<DL>
<DT><b>550</b>
<DD>Statistical Genetics I: Mendelian traits.  Offered in
Spring, recently by
Elizabeth Thompson, who is a major figure (one can say a major force)
in development of statistical genetics methodology, and by
Vladimir Minin, a rising star in areas overlapping statistical
genetics and molecular evolution.
<DT><b>551</b>
<DD>Statistical Genetics II: Quantitative Traits.  Offered each Autumn
by Bruce Weir or Tim Thornton.  Bruce has had a long and distinguished
career in statistical genetics (formerly at North Carolina State University).
Thornton is a statistical geneticist who is in the Biostatistics Department.
<DT><b>552</b>
<DD>Statistical Genetics III: Design and Analysis.  Offered some
Winters by Ellen Wijsman (Medical Genetics and Biostatistics) who is
a well-known statistical geneticist.
</DL>
<DT><b>AFS 497</b>
<DD> Advanced Population Genetic Analyses.  Discusses computer programs
for various kinds of population genetics inferences, with labs in their
use. Taught by Lorenz Hauser of the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences.
<DT><b>BIO A 482</b>
<DD> Human Population Genetics. Taught by Daryl Holman of the Department of
Anthropology's program in Biocultural Anthropology.
<DT> Other courses and people:
<DD> There are more courses and I'll gradually try to put descriptions of
them here.

<STRONG> What are some Internet resources on evolutionary biology?</STRONG>
<P>
There are many:
<P>
<STRONG> Blogs </STRONG>
<P>
There are blogs, many involved in creation / evolution debating, and some Usenet
newsgroups (which I have not listed here as they have become mostly
inactive).
I do not have enough understanding of Facebook to know what is available there.
<P>
Some brief descriptions of some of the major ones covering evolution:
<DL>
<DT> <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/blog/the-loom/">Carl Zimmer's blog</a>
<DD> Zimmer is one of the best, and best-known science journalists specializing
in evolution (you will find his pieces in many places, including the New
York Times).  He is also an author of an evolution textbook.
<DT> <a href="http://johnhawks.net/weblog">John Hawks's weblog</a>
<DD> (that's where the word "blog" came from: they were originally web-logs).
John Hawks is a physical anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin who
blogs informatively and entertainingly.
<DT> <a href="http://www.genomicron.evolverzone.com/">Genomicron</a>
<DD> T. Ryan Gregory's interesting blog covers evolutionary genomics and some other evolutionary issues. He works on transposon genomics and is at McMaster University in Canada.
<DT> <a href="http://cryptogenomicon.org">Cryptogenomicon</a>
<DD> The blog of the Eddy / Rivas lab, soon to be at Harvard
University. Sean Eddy is well-known in computational
genomics. In addition to lab business his blog has hosted some of the most
aiuthoritative and trenchant criticism of the hype surrounding the recent
release of Encode data on function of genomic elements.
<DT> <a href="http://sandwalk.blogspot.com/">Sandwalk</a>  
<DD> Named after the walking path where Darwin did a lot of his thinking, this
is written by Larry Moran, professor of Biochemistry at the University of
Toronto and author of a major biochemistry textbook.  In it he hammers
creationists, argues that natural selection is invoked too much, and promotes
his views on (actually, mostly <i>against</i>) religion.
<DT> <a href="http://www.pandasthumb.org">Panda's Thumb</a>
<DD> Blog defending evolutionary biology against creationists and advocates of
Intelligent Design, run by Reed Cartwright, a young phylogeneticist at
Arizona State University.
<DT> <a href="http://www.uncommondescent.com">Uncommon Descent</a>
<DD> Blog started by William Dembski and Denyse O'Leary, critics of
evolutionary biology and advocates of Intelligent Design.  Now run by
lawyer Barry Arrington, it regularly features O'Leary's
endlessly astonishing take on why "Darwinism" is obviously wrong.
<DT> <a href="http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/">Skeptical Zone</a>
<DD> Elizabeth Liddle, a neuroscientist in Manchester, England, was one of
the most patient, most polite, and most telling critics of Intelligent Design
in comments at Uncommon Descent.  She was banned from it in early 2012 in
a remarkable shoot-oneself-in-the-foot mass purge by the site's owner,
Barry Arrington.  
So she went out and opened up discussion on her own site, which encourages 
supporters and critics of Intelligent Design to examine each 
others' arguments without getting too rancorous.  Most of the
creationists and ID advocates avoid posting at TSZ now, but
a few still do and others come by from time to time.
The remaining commenters tend to spend a lot of
time discussing philosophy, but occasional postings about
biology do occur.
<DT> <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a> 
<DD> P. Z. Myers, who teaches biology at the University of Minnesota at Morris,
is one of the most entertaining bloggers.  He originally 
concentrated on destroying creationist arguments and explaining 
new developments in evolutionary biology. More recently his blogging
effort has been concentrated on attacking religion, and his
blog Pharyngula was
for a time one of the most highly cited in the world.  The link here
is to the limited copy of his blog content at 
Scienceblogs, which highlights the postings
on science from his full blog and omits the posts on religion.
<DT> <a href="http://phylogenomics.blogspot.com">Tree of Life</a>
<DD> Jonathan Eisen's blog. He teaches at University of California, Davis. It covers "phylogenomics" of
microbial systems and microbial metagenomics, with authority
and vigor.

</a>, a phylogeny of all life, in the
making.  Trees, figures, descriptions and references at a solid professional
level, each page done by a major systematist working on that group. Not
expanding as fast as it should but not dying either.
<li> <a href="http://www.treebase.org/treebase/">TreeBASE</a>, a database of
evolutionary trees (phylogenies)
from the scientific literature.  Weighted towards flowering plants, and
badly suffers being only sporadically updated.
<li> My own <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/phylip.html">
PHYLIP </a> free package of computer programs for inferring phylogenies.
Includes some web pages on all possible phylogeny programs and how to get
them.
<li> But maybe you don't want to be limited to just my programs?  OK,
try this listing which I maintain of all known
<a href="http://felsenst.github.io/phylip/software.html">Phylogeny
Programs</a>.  As of January 2010 there are 385 programs and 53 web servers
listed.  Many of the programs are freely downloadable.
<li> Want some DNA or protein sequences?  How about getting them from the
international database?  Try the <a
href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Database/index.html">Web pages of the
databases</a> at the
NCBI, the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the National
Library of Medicine, in Bethesda, Maryland.  Not for the faint-hearted.
<LI> The <A HREF="http://www.talkorigins.org/origins/faqs-evolution.html">
talk.origins Evolution FAQs</A> (Frequently Asked Questions) gives detailed
answers to creationist and Intelligent Design arguments.
<LI> The <A HREF="http://mcb.harvard.edu/BioLinks/Evolution.html">Harvard Bio Pages evolution page</A>, with lots of links to other
evolution resources.
<LI> The <a href="http://www.ncseweb.org">National Center for Science
Education</a> which fights the creation/evolution battle and was
instrumental in providing technical resources in the Dover School Board
court battle in 2005.

<strong>Computer simulations of population genetics</strong>
<UL>
<li> <a href="#program">See below</a> for the one we will use in this course.
<li> Reed Cartwright's <a href="http://pandasthumb.org/sims/">Red Lynx
population genetics simulator</a> runs on your browser (in Javascript) and
is somewhat similar to the simulation program (see below) that we will
use in this course.
<li> Bob Sheehy at Radford University in Virgina has <a
href="http://www.radford.edu/~rsheehy/Gen_flash/popgen/">another population
genetics simulator</a> (described as similar to mine but &ldquo;slower and more
colorful&rdquo;, written in Shockwave Flash.
<li> A <a href="http://people.brynmawr.edu/twong/toys.html">Java
simulators of genetic drift, Hardy-Weinberg proportions and four other
phenomena</a> from Ted Wong at Bryn Mawr College.
<li> <a href="http://cc.oulu.fi/~jaspi/popgen/popgen.htm">PopGen 1.0</a> from the University of Oulu, Finland.
<li> Rich Kliman of Cedar Crest College, Allentown, PA has released <a href="http://www2.cedarcrest.edu/academic/bio/rkliman/rmk_evolgenius.shtml">EvolGenius</a>, a two-locus simulation program which lets users set
fitnesses of all genotypes. (I'm still groaning at the pun in the name).
<li> John Sanford, Walter Remine, and four others have released <a href="http://mendelsaccount.sourceforge.net/">Mendel's Accountant</a>, which simulates a genome with multiple loci and both
deleterious and advantageous mutations. This program is interesting because the
people who wrote it were trying to disprove evolution (Sanford is a Young
Earth Creationist who has written a book arguing that deleterious
mutations will build up rapidly enough that humans could not have existed before
a few thousand years ago. I am not making this up.) Deleterious mutations do build up very
rapidly in runs of this program. It is not clear where that is coming from.

There are quite a few more.  Search using a search engine with the
phrase &ldquo;Population genetics simulation&rdquo;

<strong>Electronic journals</strong>
</a></p><p>
There is of course, the professional literature in evolutionary
biology.
Some of these journals (links given below) are available in
electronic versions for UW people.  If these links don't give you access
you should use the Electronic Journals links in the University Library site,
and type in the name of the journal.  If you are at another institution,
you may be able to access a different run of years of each journal.
Here are some direct UW links to the
leading journals covering evolution:

The program is freely distributable.
It is available from my server.  There you will
find source code, documentation and executables for Windows, Mac OS X, and
Unix workstations:
To fetch any of these
