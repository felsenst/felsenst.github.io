</p><h1>Evolutionary Genetics</h1><p>
</p><h2>Autumn, 2015</h2>
<p>
</p><h3>Instructor: Joe Felsenstein</h3>
<p>
</p><h3>MWF 11:30-12:20, in <a href="http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/?GNOM">S110 Foege Building</a></h3>
</div>
<p>
<b>Directions to the lecture room:</b>The building used to be reachable
from upper campus using the overpass near Kincaid Hall.  But alas,
that route is impossible owing to construction.
From upper campus,
come down 15th avenue. Foege Building is on
your left after you cross Pacific Avenue.  To reach the S (South) wing,
go halfway along the outside of the building and enter through the
opening in the building, entering the part of the building closer to
the bay.
Enter it at the door which is to the right as 
you pass through the opening in the building.  S110 is the first
room on your left as you go along this 1st floor corridor.
<P>
<P>
Oh yes, and who is the building named after?  Someone living:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Foege">This guy.</a>  Not bad!

<li> The exams will be mailed out over the next 24 hours
(Monday and Tuesday) to those students who provided an
address.  Your exam point total, your course point total, and
your grade are written on the front page near the top.
Thanks for all the questions you asked in the course.
<li> The exams have been graded, the course grades set, and
the grades submitted.  The distribution of course point totals
can be seen <a href="totals.pdf">here</a> (as a PDF
distribution with 2-point classes).  The approximate grade
ranges are indicated on it.
<li> The second computer homework is available <a href="computer2.pdf">here</a>
as a PDF.  It has many steps, so read it in advance and allow plenty of time
to do it step-by-step.  It is due on Wednesday the 25th of November, the day
before the Thanksgiving holiday.  You will also have to download some files
from the download folder which is <a href="downloads">here</a>.
<li> There will be two review sessions for the midterm exam.  One will be
1:30-2:30 on Friday the 6th of November, the other at 3:30-4:30 on Friday the
6th.  I will record both review sessions and post the sound recordings soon
after.  The Friday 3:30 session is in our classroom, S-110.  I have not yet
arranged a room for the Friday 1:30 session.
<li> Homework assignment #1 is now available, <a href="homework1.pdf">here</a>
as a PDF file.  Due one week from today, on Monday, October 26 at the midnight
at the end of that day.
<li> I have now updated the list of books on reserve for this course, to be
available in Odegaard Undergraduate Library.  The
reserve list has been submitted as of 10/1 (quite late). But it will take a
while for materials to actually be available.
<li> There is now a Genome 453 2015 email mailing list, to which I can post and
so can all registered students in the course.  We can post by emailing to
<tt>genome453a_au15@u.washington.edu</tt>  (I think you need to email from an account with the email address that is your official UW email).  If people use it to ask questions of me, I will try to answer them promptly and everyone will see the questions and answers, which may be helpful.  Archives of past messages should be available by going to  http://mailman.u.washington.edu  and searching for the list  "genome453a_au15"

<a name="textbook"><strong> Why don't we have a textbook?</strong>
</a><p>
<em>(I know it makes everyone insecure, but at the graduate level it is
standard not to have a textbook.  If you go to grad school you'll have to
get used to it.)</em>   Mostly it's because I can't come up with one that
covers adequately the particular mix of topics I give.  Make a suggestion
and we'll discuss it.  I have considered
or even used Futuyma, Maynard Smith's "Evolutionary Genetics", and others
but they don't work.   I will be handing out detailed outlines of the material
covered in lecture, and see below for electronically accessible lecture outline
and projection materials.
</a></p><hr>
<a name="lectures"><strong>Lecture materials (outlines, overheads and audio
recordings)</strong></a>
<p>
These resources are of three kinds:
<ul>
<li> <b>Lecture outlines.</b>  These are less than a text but more than an
outline.  They are PDFs of numbered lists of points covered in the lectures
(with a few points not covered but added as supplementary information).
Note that the lecture outlines this year will have some links to web
pages giving more detail, and if you are reading them on a computer
linked to the web, you can also click on those.  They are labeled as
&ldquo;<b>(old)</b>&rdquo; when they are the 2013 versions that have not yet
been updated to 2015.  They are fairly close to this year's, which will add 
some more material.
<li> <b>Lecture slides.</b>  These are the PDFs of the slides used in the
lectures.  The slide PDFs are labelled &ldquo;<b>(old)</b>&rdquo;
when they are from the previous time I gave the course, in 2013, and have not
yet been revised.  They are then preliminary versions of
the lecture PDFs.  More will be added to these before the lectures,
but they are fairly complete.
If the PDFs display on your computer rather than offer you the ability to
download them, you should be able to use the <tt>Save As</tt> choice in
the <tt>File</tt> menu on your browser to save them as PDFs.
<li> <b>Audio recordings</b>.  They will posted here after each lecture.
They will be in WMA and also in 
MP3 format.  They have names that are the date of the lecture, so that the audio
files for the lecture of 9/29 (for example) would be called  20150929.WMA and 
20150929.mp3.
</ul>
<p>
As the lectures are prepared (usually before or on the day they are to be 
given) I will try to update the lecture outlines and the computer projection
PDFs.  But sometimes I get rushed and cannot do so until after the lecture.
The projection PDFs are listed in the following table under the topic which is
being covered at the start of the talk.  I may transition to the next big topic
partway through the talk, so if you want to hear about any topic, check the
last lecture of the previous topic -- it may start there.
<p>
If you want to see material from the 2013 course, just
go <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/gs453/2013/">here</a>.  It
includes lecture outline PDFs, lecture slides, and even audio recordings of
the lectures.  But keep in mind that parts of this will change for 2015.
The numbers of lectures in each part of the course will also change some.

<a name="othercourses"> <strong> What are some other related courses?</strong>
</a><p>
</p><dl><dt>Biology 354 <em>(Foundations in Evolution and Systematics)</em>
</dt><dd> The main evolution course at the University, taught twice yearly.
This quarter (Autumn 2015) the course is given by
Jon Herron, co-author of the Freeman
and Herron evolution textbook.
In Winter 2015 this is given by Robert Bryson, a postdoctoral fellow who
works on phylogeography and biogeography.<br>
<em>What is the difference between Genome 453 and Biology 354?</em>
Biology 354 is a fine course with a somewhat different emphasis.  It is
more oriented to covering issue such as evolutionary ecology, speciation,
fossil record, and so on, while we spend more time than they do on
genetic effects -- particularly molecular evolution, chromosome evolution,
and population genetics.  There is some substantial overlap.  The syllabus
of 354 for the autumn quarter indicates that it will cover some particular
topics in more depth rather than attempt a broad survey.  </dd>
<dt> Biology 414 <em> Molecular Evolution</em>
<dd> Theoretical and empirical study of molecular evolution.  Taught Winter,
2016 by Vladimir (Volodymyr) Minin of the Department of Biology and the
Department
of Statistics, who is actively involved in developing methods for statistical
and computationally analyzing molecular evolution.
</dd>
<dt> Biology 415 <em>(Evolution and development)</em></dt>
<dd> Advanced undergraduate 
course, requiring an introductory evolution course as a prerequisite, on
"Evo-devo", the intersection of developmental biology and evolution.  This has
been an area where there have been a lot of recent advances.
I am not sure when it will next be taught.
<dt> Biology 449 <em>(Applied Phylogenetics)</em>
<dd> A course in applied aspects of phylogenetics,
with emphasis on exercises using actual data and widely-distributed programs.
Taught by Adam Leach&eacute;, who works on coalescents and phylogenies in
lizard species.  To be offered in Winter, 2016.
<dt> Biology 481 <em>(Experimental Evolutionary Ecology)</em></dt>
<dd> Lecture and
lab course on evolutionary perspectives on ecology.  Taught by
Jake Cooper, who works in this area. I do not know when this
will next be taught.</dd>
</dd><dt>Genome 562 <em>(Population Genetics)</em>
</dt><dd> Given every other year, this is the graduate theoretical
evolutionary genetics course that I give.  Lots of equations, though
mostly at a low mathematical level.  No pictures of cute furry animals.
Next time it's given will be Winter, 2017.  Text: my own extensive lecture
notes, downloaded as PDF's for free or sold inexpensively (no royalty is paid to me).
</dd><dt> Genome 570 <em>(Phylogenetic Inference)</em>
</dt><dd> This is my
graduate-level course on evolutionary trees.  Methods for inferring
phylogenies, and methods for doing things with them.  Some background
in statistics necessary.  It will be given every other
Spring (next time is Winter, 2016).  Text is my book "Inferring Phylogenies".
</dd>
<dt> Biology 550A <i>(Evolution and Systematics Seminar)</i>
<dd> A seminar Fridays at 1:30pm covering various topics in evolution.  Runs
Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters.</dd>
<dt> Biology 550B <i>(Paleo Lunch)</i> <dd>(No, the lunch is not fossilized).  A
lunchtime (Thursdays at 12:30) seminar on paleobiology. Autumn, Winter,
and Spring quarters.</dd>
</dd><dt> Others
</dt><dd> There are more courses and I'll gradually try to put descriptions of
them here.

<strong> What are some Internet resources on evolutionary biology?</strong>
</a><p>
There are many:
<P>
<STRONG> Blogs and Facebook pages</STRONG>
<P>
There are blogs, mostly for creation / evolution debating.  There
also used to be Usenet newsgroups such as <tt>sci.bio.evolution</tt>.  The
latter are accessible through Google Groups, but they are mostly defunct now.

Some brief descriptions of some of the major ones covering evolution:

Many posts about particular colorful cases of adaptations in organisms, few
about technical issues in evolutionary biology. Creationist comments are
common in the Forum section but seem to be blocked by the moderator in
the comments on the posts.</dd>

<DD>Does the name lead you to think that this is a blog by evolutionary biologists or science reporters?  Wrong.
It is a blog sponsored by the Discovery Institute, which promotes Intelligent
Design.  Don't get me started ...

<a name="internet"><strong>Electronic journals</strong>
</a></p><p>
There is of course, the professional literature in evolutionary
biology. Contrary to popular belief, scientists don't publish their works
primarily by writing books.  They publish papers in scientific journals.
Some of these journals (links given below) are available in
electronic versions for UW people.  <b>If these links don't give you access
you should use the Electronic Journals links in the University Library site,
and type in the name of the journal</b>.  Here are some direct links to the
leading journals covering evolution:

<li> The amazing <a href="http://tolweb.org/tree"> Tree of Life </a>, a phylogeny of all life, in the
making.  Trees, figures, descriptions and references at a solid professional
level, each page done by a major systematist working on that group.  Much
more complete for some groups than others.  Explore!
<li> <a href="http://www.timetree.org">The TimeTree of Life</a> finds
estimated divergence times for many (pairs of) species.  Includes a lot

listed.  Many of the programs are freely downloadable.  Outdated and needs
updating.
<li> The <a href="http://www.paleoportal.org/">Paleontology Portal</a> run by

California Museum of Paleontology gives information on many groups and their
fossils.

a sort of "virtual museum".

international database?  Try the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Database/index.html">Web pages of the databases</a> at the
NCBI, the National Center for Biotechnology Information of the National
Library of Medicine, in Bethesda, Maryland.  Not for the faint-hearted.

comparative genomics for other mammalian species.  See the genomics data
not as some textbook illustration, but as the genomic &ldquo;pros&rdquo; see it.
<li> <a href="http://www.orthomam.univ-montp2.fr/orthomam/html/">OrthoMam</a> is a good collection of most gene families
in mammals, aligned, and even with trees computed for each.  You can get
<i>lots</i> of data here.  A good test of the reality of common descent is to
see whether different genes give noticeably similar evolutionary trees (they
won't be exactly the same for a number of reasons, including noisy data).  Do
they?

<strong> Where can I get a copy of the computer programs? </strong>
</a><p>
<a name="program">There are three computer programs available.
Students in the course will be asked to run two of them,
and submit a report of the results.  The details of the
assignments will be handed out later.  One program, PopG, simulates evolution
of gene frequencies of two alleles at a single locus in the presence of
genetic drift, natural selection, mutation, and migration. The first
computer exercise will consist of running this.
The second program, ContEvol, is presented here in case you might
want to play with it -- it will not be used in an assignment.
It simulates the evolution of a quantitative character which is controlled
by 5 loci, under the action of natural selection towards an optimum
phenotype.  The third program, Dnatree,
simulates the branching of a phylogeny, the evolution of a DNA sequence
along those branches, and allows the user to search by manually
rearranging the tree for the most parsimonious tree, and see whether this
recovers the true tree.  This will be used for the second computer assignment.
</a></p><p>
<a name="program">The first program is available in newly updated form.  The other two are
older and have a clunkier interface.
</a></p><p>
<a name="program"><strong>(1) PopG -- Simulation of gene frequency evolution</strong>
</a><p>
This program is freely distributable.  It is distributed as a Java program.
You need to make sure that you have Java on your computer.  Mac OS X systems
and Linux systems tend to have Java.  For Windows systems Java can be
downloaded and installed from <a href="http://java.com">here</a>.
