<P>
<li> Joan and I are currently (5 November 2021) sheltering at home since 2 March 2020, working remotely,
reachable by email.  All well so far, and we are fully vaccinated as well.
<p>
<li> I was recently awarded a 2020 <a href="https://ncse.ngo/friend-darwin-awards">Friend of Darwin Award</a> by the National Center for Science Education.  Youtube
 video of the online award ceremony <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PV-tsFJbrY">here</a>.
<p>
<li> The Felsenstein / Kuhner lab was closed at the end of 2017.  I now have a retirement office
(S432) and Mary Kuhner, Jon Yamato, and Lucian Smith were given an office (S332) of
their own.  In 2020 Mary and Jon became associated with Sam Wasser's lab in the Biology Department, and their office in Foege was closed.  I also have a desk in room 472 of the Biology Department's new Life Sciences Building, in an area with multiple student desks and desks for retired faculty
members.  The rooms of the old Felsenstein / Kuhner lab, S420, are now the lab of our new population genetics hire Kelley Harris.
<P>
<li> I retired on October 1, 2017 and now have more time to do research on things of interest to me, and to catch up with work on PHYLIP.
<p>
<li>In the issue of <i>Nature</i> published on
29 October 2014, they
published a list of
the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-top-100-papers-1.16224">top 100
most-cited scientific papers</a> of all
time. My 1985 bootstrap paper was #41.  Overall 5 of the 100 
were in phylogenetics (Saitou and Nei's 1987 paper on the
Neighbor-Joining method was #20).  There were also a number
of bioinformatics papers, with papers on ClustalW and BLAST
being #10 and #12, respectively.

Quantitative Genetics Workshop</a>.  I co-founded and have co-led this with
Steve Arnold of Oregon State University since 2011.  Since 2017 it has been
given at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the UW on beautiful San Juan Island.
For people who want to know more, here are <a

The links in the 2019 schedule there lead to pages for the lectures that have
lecture projections and audio recordings of the lectures.
The workshop was given  in 2019 from 10-14 June. The 2020
workshop has been cancelled; we hope to have it in an online version in 2021.<br>
