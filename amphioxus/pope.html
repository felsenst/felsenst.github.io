Philip H. Pope was the author of the verses of <A HREF="amphioxus.html">
"It's a Long Way to
Amphioxus"</A>.  In 1921 he and his fiancee Louise Smith were attending
a summer course in biology at the Biological Laboratory of the 
<a href="http://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/History/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> on Long Island, New York.  They heard some 
students singing the chorus
to the song, and Louise commented that Philip should write verses for the
song.  He did.

<P>
Philip and Louise both came from Maine (Manchester and Augusta, respectively).
They met on a class trip to Washington, DC, when Philip was 21 and Louise was
14.  Louise went to college and did graduate work at Smith College.  Philip
was an undergraduate at Bowdoin College, and went on to do graduate work
at Harvard, completing a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in the
area of herpetology.
<P>
Philip proposed to Louise that summer at Cold Spring Harbor, and they were
subsequently married.
(Louise broke off her graduate work just short of her Ph.D. to, as her
daughter Edith says, "get her P.H.P. instead").
Philip Pope spent one year teaching biology at Reed College in 1922.  In 1923
an infection of tuberculosis became active, and he entered the 
Veterans' Hospital in Walla Walla, Washington.  That year their
daughter Edith was born.
Philip Pope remained in the hospital for 6 years.  After leaving the hospital he had
no job, and they tried farming.  In 1930 the Popes were offered jobs teaching
Biology at Whitman College in Walla Walla.  They remained on its faculty until
their retirement (Philip retired in 1953, Louise in 1962).   Their daughter
Edith remembers field trips by car to the Columbia River not far from Walla
Walla, with the Popes and their students singing biological songs as they
drove.  Philip also contributed substantially to the
collections of the Whitman College Herbarium.
<P>
Both Philip and Louise died in 1970.
<P>
The house where the Popes lived was called "The Vatican".  Some feeling for
their sense of humor will be found in the

article in the Whitman Magazine about Louise Smith Pope</A>, which is available on the web.
