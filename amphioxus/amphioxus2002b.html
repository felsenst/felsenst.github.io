<h1>Earliest appearances of The Amphioxus Song</h1>
</div>
<p>
The 2001-2002 Amphioxus research season revealed new information,
including what are probably the earliest forms of the song.  Edith Pope asked her
son-in-law and daughter Tom and Suki Boydston to look in some old
family papers.  There they found a hand-written and type-written songbook
with Philip Pope's name on it, dated 1921, Cold Spring Harbor Lab.
Inserted into it was a piece of paper with typed lyrics of the song.
They have kindly sent me a copy, which you can see by clicking

A chance encounter in Woods Hole with <a
HREF="http://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2153">Bob Josephson</a> of the University of California, Irvine, led
him to explore the MBL library archives.  Based on encouraging reports from
him, I mounted an expedition in August, 2002.  Jean Monahan, the MBL
archivist, showed me early songbooks and songsheets including:

<p>
<ul>
<li>A 1921 mimeographed songbook entitled: "Songs of MBL" and described as
"Songs selected from those popular at the M.B.L. in 1921.  And the collection
sold for the benefit of the M.B.L. Tennis Club."  Most of the songs were
popular folk and comic songs well-known today.  Among them was one called
simply "Amphioxus" and which consisted only of the chorus, which was given as:
<br>
<table BGCOLOR=#ccffff ALIGN=CENTER><tr><td>
It's a long way from Amphioxus<br>
It's a long way to us<br>
It's a long way from Amphioxus<br>
To the meanest human cuss<br>
It's goodbye fins and gill slits<br>
Welcome skin and hair<br>

It's a long way from Amphioxus<br>
But we came from there
</td></tr></table>
There was no author given.  Presumably this is the form of the chorus that
the Popes heard at Cold Spring Harbor Labs that summer.
<p>
<li>Another mimeographed songbook entitled "Songs of MBL, second edition, 1922".
It contains a full set of verses under the title "Amphioxus", attributing the
song to Philip Pope.
</ul>
<p>
These early versions of the song show noticeable differences in
exact wording ("skin and hair" versus "lungs and hair", for example),
so that we can assume that some of the population-level variation in the
words has been extant since the beginning.
<p>
These are probably the earliest forms of the song we will find.  The 1921
MBL songbook has the chorus, which circulated anonymously at MBL and CSHL
and must have been written some time after 1912, when "Tipperary" was
written.  The 1922 songbook shows Pope's verses reaching MBL the year after
he composed them.
