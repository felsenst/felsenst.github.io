<h2>Joe Felsenstein's courses</h2>
<P>
In each case the link below is to the web page for the most recent year that I taught it.   Many of the
courses have links to audio recordings of the lectures in WMA and also in
MP3 format.  Using them and the lecture presentation PDFs you can hear and
see what was presented at each lecture.  All that's missing is an animated
stick figure of me brandishing a laser pointer.

a course and does not happen every week -- the schedule is announced on a

list</a>, whose email address is

PopGenLunch started as a weekly seminar about 1973, and continued under my
coordination until spring of 2018.  After that it will be led by Kelley
Harris.  The mailing list and schedule link should continue to work.

I retired in October of 2017, so I will not teach any courses from then on.

course web pages may be unavailable.  But I do have lecture PDFs and homework
assignment PDFs on my server, you can find my lecture PDFs and
homework PDFs by using the 2010 links for them, but changing "2010" to the

<h3>Summer courses</h3>
<P>
I have taught in three summer courses, and these days teach in one or two each
summer.  Here are links to the most recent
occurrences.  They include PDFs of my projections and audio files of my
talks.<br>
<P>
<b>Courses given recently</b><br>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://fhl.uw.edu/courses/course-descriptions/course/evolutionary-quantitative-genetics-workshop-2022/"><b>Evolutionary
Quantitative Genetics Workshop</b></a>.  I co-founded and have co-led this with
Steve Arnold of Oregon State University since 2011.  Since 2017 it has been
given at the Friday Harbor Laboratories of the UW on beautiful San Juan Island.
For people who want to know more, here are <a
href="https://EQGW.github.io/">the blog pages for the workshop</a>.
The links in the 2019 schedule there lead to pages for the lectures that have
lecture projections and audio recordings of the lectures.
The workshop was not given in 2020 owing to the pandemic.  It was given
as an online workshop in 2021 from 12 July to 16 July.  The materials for
2021 can be found there under the heading of Previous Years.  They include
video recordings of the lectures as well as slides and materials for exercises.
Links to the web pages for previous years' workshops are also available at the link
for Previous Years at the blog page.  For some of these years videos of the lectures are
available.
</ul>
<b>Courses formerly given</b></br>
<ul>
<li> <b>Workshop on Molecular Evolution</b> at the Marine Biological Laboratory
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts in late July.  From 1988 to 2015 I taught in this
workshop a total of 24 times (missing it in 1996, 1998, 2008, and 2010). 
In recent years I gave <a href="http://molevol.mbl.edu/index.php/User:Felsenst">two lectures</a>, one on using phylogenies to make inferences about
morphological characters, and one on the history of numerical work on
phylogenies.
and I also sang <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/amphioxus/">The
Amphioxus Song</a> at their lobster banquet.
<li> <b>Summer Institute in Statistical Genetics</b> at the University of
Washington in July.  I have co-taught the <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/sisg/2016/">Molecular Phylogenetics module</a> with
Mark Holder and Jeff Thorne.  We taught the module from 2010 through 2016, except for 2015.  Web
pages for the module in those years can be found by changing the number of the year in the above
link.
