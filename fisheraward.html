<div><table border=1><tr><td>The following is a copy of an email I sent to the Council of the Society for the Study of Evolution on 23 March 2021.  It gives my further thoughts
on an earlier letter that I signed, about the SSE's statement about R.A. Fisher and the SSE award that had been named after him.
That earlier letter was also signed by eight other past officers of the SSE.
  I have redacted the name of one of those officers which appeared in this letter.</td></tr></div>

<P>
SSE Council members --
<P>
I am sending hereby some additional thoughts on the issues.  I have
signed the statement by [REDACTED] et al., but have additional thoughts.
<P>
I have some disagreements with the statement -- I think it
overemphasizes the conclusion that Fisher abandoned his support of
eugenics after 1941.  It also does not note his repulsive postwar
statement about how sincere the Nazis were about eugenics, as well as
the most consequential misdeed of his, his denialism of the connection
between smoking and lung cancer.   There must be some number of
smokers who continued on because of him, and suffered accordingly.  As
did Fisher himself.  (I realize that those issues were addressed in
the article by Walter Bodmer and others that is cited in the
statement).
<P>
These may justify removing Fisher's from the SSE award.  But I do find
troublesome the statements that his actions "call into question" the
validity of his work.  How do we make that criterion work?   We know
that Isaac Newton was a weird obsessive and a major jerk and asshole,
who did some quite dishonest things such as probably destroying the
only known portrait of his rival Robert Hooke, and rigging a committee
that was supposed to dispassionately judge the conflicts over his
priority for the discovery of the calculus.  Does that call into
question the use of his laws when building bridges?     If, having
called them into question, we build a bridge without Newton's Laws,
and the bridge falls down, will the relatives of the victims feel
sympathy with our abhorrence of Newton's Laws?
<P>
 Another aspect of the statement that I fully support is its pointing
out the dubious statements of other major figures in evolutionary
biology, and raising the question of why we do not take similar
offense in their case.
<P>
If we are to have awards named after scientists who made major
contributions, we should find a way to make it clear that the naming
of the awards is in honor of the scientific work of the person named,
and is not an endorsement of other aspects of their life.  Given the
tendency we all have to hero-worship, that is not an easy thing to do.
  Or perhaps we just shouldn't put peoples' names on awards.
<P>
Joe<br>
