This is a text which is used in my Genome 562 course.  It was originally
written in the late 1970's, and many parts of it have not been updated since
about 1981.   A major part of the new chapter on molecular population genetics
and most of a chapter on multiple linked loci, plus a chapter on polygenic
characters in natural populations, has been added more recently.
It was to be a book, but I became involved in work on phylogenies,
and it has been published as lecture notes ever since.  A small amount of new
material has been added each time it was privately reprinted by me for use
in my class.  It was originally on a magnetic-card storage system for
electric typewriters, and then migrated to the Runoff family of mathematical
text formatting systems, and finally to LaTeX with Postscript figures.
<P>
I am gradually finishing it, year by year.  In the meantime:
