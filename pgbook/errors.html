<TD>258</TD><TD>In Box 1, equation (VII-11)</TD><TD>should have 4Nq instead of
4N. The resulting value of F is<br> 1/(4Nu+1) for all cases. I have also since
discovered that<br> the (correct) derivation was published by Dan Hartl and
<br> Russ Campbell in 1982 in <i>Genetics</i>, and that should have been cited.</TD></TR>
<TD>350</TD><TD>D' values in the figure<BR> are incorrect.</TD><TD>They were calculated with
a<BR>program that had a bug.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
These errors are corrected in the 2015 edition.  More errors have been found in
that edition, and I hope soon to post some corrections of them here.
