<p>
ERRATUM: There is one typographical error in the manuscript.  In equation
7.4, in the numerator of the central term, there is a "Pi" which should have
been the Greek capital letter Pi, symbolizing a repeated product, similar to
the expression in the denominator of the central term.  But the backslash
symbol was left off in a typographical error, so LaTeX never converted the
letters "P" and "i" to the Greek capital letter.
