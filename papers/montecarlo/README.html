This directory contains the paper:

    Felsenstein, J.   1992.   Estimating effective population size from
       population samples of sequences: a bootstrap Monte Carlo approach.
       Genetical Research  59: 139-147 (December issue).

    [note -- the method proposed in this paper is <b>wrong</b>.  It has been shown to
        give a biased estimate of theta.  The paper by Felsenstein, 
        Yamato, and Kuhner corrects this.  That paper 
        is available here in directory
        <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/papers/metro">http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/papers/metro</a>
        and the program to implement it is 
        <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/lamarc.html">the LAMARC package</a>.   ]

PLEASE NOTE -- The method proposed in this paper has since been shown to
be incorrect.  In 1995 (Kuhner, Yamato Felsenstein) we explained why and
proposed an alternative Hastings/Metropolis method that gives correct
results.  It is of the same general form as the one proposed here but
has some important changes to eliminate the problem of the likelihood
curve having infinite area under it, which was the source of the problem.
