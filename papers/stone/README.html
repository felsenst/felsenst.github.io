Note that the equations describing my methods in this paper <b>are mostly
wrong</b>.  I complained about this, but the other authors said this would be
"clearer to the readers", and I was outvoted.  For more correct equations
see <a href="http://evolution.gs.washington.edu/papers/spectrum/">my 2002
paper</a>.
