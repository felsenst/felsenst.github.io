<title>Erratum for Felsenstein, 2006 paper</title>
</head>
<body>
The citation to the paper by Fu and Li, 1993, given in this
paper is to a very nice paper, but it is the wrong paper by
Fu and Li in 1993.  There was another one in that year by
those authors.
<p>
The correct citation should have been to this paper:
<pre>
   Fu, Y. X. and Li, W.-H.  1993.  Estimating effective population size from 
      samples of sequences: inefficiency of pairwise and segregating sites as
      compared to phylogenetic estimates. Genetics  134: 1261-1270.
