Please note carefully that these papers, as published in the journals, are
copyright to the publishers of those journals.


Note that in each case these are the final versions as submitted to the
journal (the last full manuscript version) but do not reflect changes that
the editor or I may have made in proof.  Published quotations of these
manuscripts should be based on the published version; quotations
before publication should be checked with me by e-mail.


In addition, many of my older papers are available on-line in the JSTOR system
which makes older academic journals available.  Your institution would need
to have a subscription to JSTOR for it to be available to you.  Links to
these papers are available in my Curriculum Vitae which is 
[at this link](felsenstein.cv.html)

It also has links to on-line copies of some of my papers at the sites of
the journals that published them.  These too may require subscriptions.

## Supplementary materials for earlier work ##

For earlier work, including earlier papers, I am making available 
materials including the computer programs that were used for the 
numerical examples.  I am gradually putting more of these online.
For now there is this case:
