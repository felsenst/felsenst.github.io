Bibliography of Theoretical Population Genetics<BR>

<P>
The file "bible" contains the input entries used to create the Bibliography of
Theoretical Population Genetics in 1981.  The last entries are very early 1981.
<P>
You are entirely welcome to download and use the Bibliography, as long as
you preserve its copyright and do not charge anyone money for it or for
access to it.
<P>
You should be able to search for keywords by simply reading this file into
an editor or word processor, and using its Find function.
<P>
Each entry consists of lines of ASCII characters no more than 80 bytes long.
There are three groups of lines in each entry, the Author lines, the Title
lines, and the Reference lines.  Format should be self-explanatory.  The only
tricky part is knowing when a group ends.
<P>
The general rule is that if an 80-column line has anything nonblank in either 
column 79 or column 80, that field (Author, Title, or Reference) is to
continue to another line.  So you keep reading lines until you come
to one that is either shorter than 79 characters, or is 79 characters long and
has a blank in column 79, or is 80 characters long with columns 79 and 80 
both blank.  Note that when a field is exactly 79 or 80 characters long this 
convention requires an extra, totally blank line to follow it to terminate the
field.
<P>
Author names are inverted for the first name but not for subsequent ones.
Blanks in the family name of an author are replaced by asterisks as in
"Maynard*Smith".  The year of publication is always the last four nonblank 
characters of the Reference line. 
<P>
I would like to hear about any interesting transmutations of this form of the 
Bibliography.  I may resume updating it some day.  A more certain way of
ensuring that it is updated is for you to volunteer to do it.
<P>
There was formerly a site at  <tt>gopher.gdb.org</tt>  that would do interactive
searches of these files.  It was maintained by Dan Jacobson.  It is
still there but does not work anymore.  However, a new version has been
constructed by Martin Morgan at Washington State University, as web site at:<br>
  <code>http://www.wsu.edu/~mmorgan/interactivities/felsenbib.cgi</code><br>
which allows an interactive search using keywords, including combinations
using operations such as AND and NOT.  Many thanks to him for this great
service.
<P>
As for the printed form of the Bibliography, it was printed by Dowden,
Hutchinson, and Ross of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania in an edition of 500
copies.  368 of these sold, a few were given to me as personal copies, and
the rest (120 copies or so) were remaindered to a bookseller in
Connecticut, who used to sell them for $5 each.  Now I hear those are
sold out, but copies still are available on the used book market
(go to <a href="www.abebooks.com">www.abebooks.com</a> or <a href="www.bookfinder.com">www.bookfinder.com</a> and search using the name
"Felsenstein, Joseph").
