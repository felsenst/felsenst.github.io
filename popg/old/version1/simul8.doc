                     Simul8 genetic simulation program
 
 This is a one-locus, two-allele genetic simulation program for use by
 students.  There are executable versions for (1) 386, 486 or Pentium,
 (2) pre-386 DOS machines such as PC/AT's and PC/XT's and their clones,
 (3) PowerMacs, (4) Macintoshes, (5) DEC Alphas under Digital Unix,
 (6) 386, 486, or Pentium systems under Linux, (7) Sun SPARCs, (8) IBM
 RS6000 AIX systems, and (9) DECstations.  The C source code is provided,
 which can be compiled with the Makefile to produce executable versions for
 most workstations that have X windows.


 THE EXECUTABLES

 The file names of these executables are
     simul8.exe          pre-386 DOS version
     simul386.exe        386/486/Pentium DOS version
     simul8.alpha        DEC Alpha Unix version
     simul8.linux        Linux 386/486/Pentium version
     simul8.sun          Sun SPARC version
     simul8.rs6          IBM RS6000 AIX version
     simul8.ds           DECstation version
     simul8PPC.bin       Macintosh version for PowerMacs
     simul868.bin        Macintosh version for 68k (non-PowerMac) machines

 If you get simul386.exe, you should also get dos4gw.exe, the Rational Systems
 DOS extender, which must be put into the root directory (C:\) of your system.  
 It is legally redistributable by us along with the compiled code
 simul386.exe.
 
 To run the program, you should simply type SIMUL386 or SIMUL8, which cause
 the program SIMUL386.EXE or SIMUL8.EXE to be read into the computer's memory
 and executed.
 
 The program uses a random number generator.  It should give you a different 
 result every time it is run. 
 
 For the Sun or DEC executables just make sure the executable has execute
 permission (the command is "chmod +x simul8.sun", "chmod +x simul8.dec",
 or "chmod +x simul8.alpha").  That only needs to be done once.

 To run them type the name of the program.

 The Macintosh version provided here is a variant of a program, PoPG 1.0,
 written by Mark Wells.  That in turn was based on an earlier version of
 Simul8.  It is started by double-clicking on the program icon.   It opens
 a window to set parameter values, then is controlled using the Run and File
 menus.  It has two migration models (stepping-stone and source/sink) that
 are not found in the other versions of Simul8.  There are two executables
 provided, Simul8PPC and Simul868.  The former is for PowerMac systems, the
 second for older (68k non-PowerMac) systems, although it too can run,
 somewhat slowly, on PowerMacs.  Note that as stored in this ftp area,
 the executables are MacBinary files and must be transferred with an
 ftp program that can translate these (such as Fetch).


 COMPILING IT YOURSELF ON WORKSTATIONS

 If you want to compile the program yourself on a workstation, instructions
 are as follows (if, not, you can skip this section).

 The Makefile can be used on most Unix workstation to compile the program
 by simply putting simul8.c and the Makefile into a directory and then
 typing "make".  That will tell you what to do (which depends on your
 workstation).  If that does not work, then use one of these:

       cc simul8.c -DX -lm -lX11 -o simul8

 or if you are on Openwindows on a Sun SPARCstation:

       cc simul8.c -DX -lm -lX11 -o simul8\
           -I/usr/openwin/include -L/usr/openwin/lib -o simul8
       (where the \ means the line continues to the next line, but you do not
        type a "\")

 The resulting executable (simul8) can display on any X terminal or X-capable
 workstation.

 If you are compiling on a Sun SPARC for use on Suns other than the one on
 which you are compiling, you might want to add the switch "-Bstatic"
 to force the compilation to not use dynamically linked libraries, as
 these may differ among machines and cause trouble.

 
 RUNNING SIMULATIONS WITH SIMUL8
 
 This program simulates the evolution of random-mating populations with two 
 alleles, arbitrary fitnesses of the three genotypes, an arbitrary mutation 
 rate, an arbitrary rate of migration between the replicate populations, and
 finite population size.

 The program is written to work on a variety of different systems, with several 
 different graphics displays.  When the program starts running it asks you to 
 choose one of the displays.  You will probably want to choose the graphics
 setting, (option number 1).

 On DOS systems the colors of the graph may be hard to read.  To
 change them choose option 0 when the main menu appears.  On X-windows
 systems the window for the gene frequency plots has an irritating
 tendency to overlap the area where you are supposed to type, and the
 text window where you are to type may have to be clicked on to make it active
 too.  You will want to resize the main text window and/or move it out of the
 way.

 The Macintosh version is based on a program, PopGen 1.0, written by Mark Wells
 for Doug Schemske of our Botany Department.  That in turn was based on earlier
 versions of Simul8.  It has two versions, one for 68k Macs and one for
 PowerMacs.  Although the first will also run on PowerMacs, it is better to run
 the native PowerMac code, as that runs more quickly.  On old Macs that do not
 have a math coprocessor the program will run very slowly as it is emulating
 math coprocessor functions, which is slow.

 The programs simulate eight simultaneously evolving populations with you
 specifying the population size (less than or equal to 10000), the fitnesses
 of the three genotypes, the mutation rates in both directions (from A to a
 and from a to A), and the initial gene frequency.  They also ask for a
 migration rate among all the populations, which will make their gene
 frequencies more similar to each other.  Much of the time (but not always!)
 you will want to set this to zero.  In most respects the programs are
 self-explanatory. 

 When you run the program a main menu appears showing you the settings of
 these parameters.  In the DOS and Unix versions you change any of them by
 typing the digit (0 through 9) that appears on the left side of that line.
 The program will then ask you for a new value of that parameter.  You can
 reset any or all of them.  In the Macintosh and PowerMac versions you edit
 the values that appear in the menu in the usual Macintosh way.

 The program will display a plot of the gene frequencies for that case
 for each of the populations, plus a dashed curve that shows what the
 gene frequencies would be in an infinite population.  In the DOS and Unix
 versions, after showing the proper number of generations the program asks you
 if you want to specify the number of generations to simulate.  If you just
 press the Enter key at this point you get another run of the same number of
 generations.  If you type in the number "0" it will stop the simulation
 and return to the main menu.  The number of populations in which the
 allele A has been fixed and the number in which it has been lost are also
 shown.

 In the Mac and PowerMac versions you should use the Run menu to Continue
 the run, or its Start option to start a new run with the same parameter
 values, or its New Case option to choose new parameter values for a new run.
 You can stop by choosing the Quit option from the File menu.  In the Mac and
 PowerMac versions you can also resize the graph by altering the lower-right
 corner of the graph's window.

 In the DOS and Unix versions, you can also type "P" when asked for the number
 of generations.  This causes the program to write out a file in the Postscript
 language that plots a graph of the current screen.  You will be asked for a
 file name.  After you have finished running the program, you can send that
 file to a Postscript printer (such as an Apple Laserwriter, but not an HP
 Laserjet-compatible printer unless it has been equipped with a Postscript
 cartridge).  On PCDOS this is done by a command like (if the file name
 is FOO.PS)  COPY FOO.PS PRN:, on workstations you may be able to use the
 "lpr foo.ps" command.  After writing the file when you type P and
 specify the file name, the system returns to asking you about the number
 of generations you want to simulate.

 On the Mac and PowerMac version you can choose the Print option from the
 File menu to print the current graph to your computer's printer.  Note that
 if you have resized the graph, you may find that it prints past the margin
 of the paper, unless you use Landscape printing.

 The program can simulate a wide variety of cases, and you should
 explore some of these.
