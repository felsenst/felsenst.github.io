These are rather preliminary versions of a simple one-locus
population genetics simulation program I use in my classes.
The DOS, Unix, Mac, and PowerMac versions of the current simulation
program are in directory "pub/popgen" (the parent directory of this
one).  

The Macintosh versions in this directory are modifications of our code by Mark
Wells and are posted here with his permission.

PopG_2.0.bin           Macintosh executables for Macs with no math coprocessors

PopG_2.0_68881.bin     Macintosh executables for Macs with math coprocessors

PopGen_2.0_Instructions   How to use the Mac executables, in MS Word format

These three Macintosh files are in MacBinary format.
