# Why was I an author on a paper in a eugenics journal? #
<p>&nbsp;</p>

One of my earliest papers, in 1968, was this one:

Crow, J. F. and J. Felsenstein.  1968.  The effect of assortative mating on the genetic composition of a 
population.  _Eugenics Quarterly_ #15:# 85-97.

## The content of the paper ##

The paper gives derivations of the covaraiances between relatives in a population that is not 
random-mating, but has a character for which there is assortative mating, that is, for which 
individuals who mate are more likely to be similar in that character.  Examples would be 
people who tend to marry someone who is of a similar height.

## Where does the paper fit into the literature? ##

R. A. Fisher gave a derivation in his major 1918 paper on the theory of quantitative genetics 
derived results on how much assortative mating would increase additive genetic variance in the 
character for which there was assortative mating.  But his derivation was very hard to 
follow.  Sewall Wright, in one of his pioneering papers on inbreeding in 1921, had a 
similar result, derived using his own method of "path coefficients".  But even that was hard to follow.
Jim Crow was working on materials for his 1970 book with Motoo Kimura.  For the section 
on assortative mating, he found a way to use kinship coefficients to derive Wright's 
result.  I read the draft of this and figured out a way to generalize his result to 
cases where the trait was caused by a mix of genes of large and small effects.  So I 
was made co-author on a paper.  (I do still wonder whether one of the steps I used in my 
derivation was actually justifiable).

## Is the paper about eugenics? ##

No.  It is not at all about effects of preferentially breeding from some people and not 
from others.  In the model in the paper, every member of the population is equally able to have offspring.

## So why is it in a journal once devoted to eugenics? ##

James F. Crow, the senior author, wanted it there.  He was one of the major people who 
revived work in human genetics after World War II, when much of it was discredited by 
the association of advocates of eugenics with the horrors that Nazi ideology led to.
He was an associate of H.J. Muller, who pioneered work on mutations in human 
populations, and human genetic loads.  Muller (and Crow) did not want eugenics to be completely ruled out, 
in cases such as trying to reduce the numbers of harmful mutations in the population.
I think Jim was trying not to totally abandon having some future eugenics program.
With our ability to detect new mutations and to engage in genetic engineering to 
directly change those loci, the idea of using a eugenics program to reduce the numbers 
of deleterious mutations is now obsolete.

## Was the journal full of other articles on eugenics? ##

By then, the journal had almost entirely changed to publishing articles about 
demography -- the study of patterns of birth and death rates, and the growth 
rates of populations.  Later, the journal 
changed its name to "Social Biology", and more recently, to "Biodemography and 
Social Biology".

## Did I have qualms about publishing there? ##

Yes, I recall feeling a bit queasy when that journal was proposed. 
But I read other articles in the journal, and concluded that 
people would look at them and understand that this journal was by 
then not really about eugenics.   Perhaps I was wrong about assuming 
that people would check that and be understanding!

## Am I in favor of eugenics? ##

No, I am not. If someone proposed to get a broad acceptance in society of having a program of 
breeding humans, similar to animal breeding, they'd have to answer three questions:

1. Can we all decide on an objective?  For example, do we all want people to be six feet 
tall, and make sure all have enough muscles to guarantee them an Olympic gold medal?

2. Can we ensure that there won't be unwanted side effects?  For example, the breeding 
of German Shepherd Dogs (Alsatians) to have sturdy-looking hind quarters ended up 
leading to high rates of congenital hip dislocation.  Oops.

3. Can we do this without massively violating human rights?  By, for example telling 
people who can have children and who can't.  I don't think we can.

I think the answer to, not just one or two, but all three of these is clearly "no".  And 
in fact there is basically no country in the world right now that has a eugenics program, 
or is even talking about one.  There are alarming 
neo-fascist movements, in many countries, that have racist fantasies about breeding people to 
be blonde "Aryans" (or whatever). But instituting eugenics programs is not the 
main danger they pose -- that would be very slow and cumbersome, while there are 
many more immediate dangers if they take power.

## What about racism? Isn't that the main focus of eugenics? ##

If you go back and actually read the papers written in the literature of eugenics, 
you may be confused to find that most of them are not focused on racial differences, 
but on class differences.  They were alarmed that better educated people were 
having more children than less well-educated people.  They imagined society being 
overwhelmed by working-class people's children.   Of course, eugenicists were 
hereditarians, in that they attributed most differences between groups of people 
to genetics.  So of course that meant that they tended to carry this over to any 
discussion of race.  But the literature is actually mostly about class.
