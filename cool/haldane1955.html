<blockquote>
"What is more interesting, it is only in such small populations that natural
selection would favour the spread of genes making for certain kinds of
altruistic behaviour.  Let us suppose that you carry a rare gene which affects
your behaviour so that you jump into a river and save a child, but you have
one chance in ten of being drowned, while I do not possess the gene, and stand
on the bank and watch the child drown.  If the child is your own child or
your brother or sister, there is an even chance that the child will also have
the gene, so five such genes will be saved in children for one lost in an
adult.  If you save a grandchild or nephew the advantage is only two and a
half to one.  If you only save a first cousin, the effect is very slight.
If you try to save your first cousin once removed the population is more
likely to lose this valuable gene than to gain it.  But on the two occasions
when I have pulled possibly drowning people out of the water (at an
infinitesimal risk to myself) I had no time to make such calculations.
Paleolithic men did not make them.  It is clear that genes making for conduct
of this kind would only have a chance of spreading in rather small populations
where most of the children were fairly near relatives of the man who risked
his life.  It is not easy to see how, except in small populations, such genes
could have been established.  Of course the conditions are even better in a
community such as a beehive or an ants' nest, whose members are all literally
brothers and sisters."

<P>
I don't know whether anyone has noticed a subtle issue here.  Haldane
envisages a small population so that everyone is related; the benefit
seems to accrue to a random member of the population.  It therefore cannot
raise the frequency of the altruism allele within that population -- in fact it
decreases it by the risk to the altruist.  But it could benefit the
whole population (by benefiting a random member of it) and make it have a
greater contribution to the weighted gene frequency in the whole
species.  Thus it seems that this is more a case of group selection than
kin selection.  In fact, as noted by Crow and Aoki (PNAS 1982)
the Hamilton kin selection formula also works for group selection, so
the distinction is in any case unclear.  Haldane has the essential logic of
the Hamilton argument, but in this case is applying it to group selection.
