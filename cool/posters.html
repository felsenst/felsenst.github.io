<H2>Help judge posters at SMBE 2014</H2>
<P>
Are you a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow?  And are you planning to
attend the 2014 SMBE meeting in San Juan, Puerto Rico?
<P>
You can help me, and help everyone, by becoming a judge in the poster sessions.
I am organizing the judging, and we will need many judges.
<P>
What you have to do:
<P>
<ol>
<LI> You will be assigned a poster session and a list of 30-40 posters (probably
contiguously numbered so they are all near each other).  You will be given a
rating form on which you score each poster 1 to 5 (5 is highest).
<li> If you have a poster yourself, you will not be asked to do this in that
poster session, as I know you need time to "stand" your poster.
<li> Each judge will do the task during one of the poster sessions, and
turn the scores in to me.  This should not interfere with any
of your other activities at the meeting.
<li> Don't worry that you have too little experience to do this.  We need
judges of all levels of sophistication.  One of the properties of a good poster
is to communicate clearly to beginners, and we need people who can rate this.
</OL>
<P>
Your participation is important to us.  All I can offer in return is my
gratitude plus buying you one drink, if you want.
<P>
If you can't do this, tell some friends about this wonderful opportunity.
We need many more judges.
