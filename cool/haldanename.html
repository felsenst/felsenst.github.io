<body><P><h1>J. B. S. Haldane</h1><P>
Human geneticist, evolutionary biologist, one of the three founders of
theoretical population genetics (and thus of the modern evolutionary
synthesis).  He also was a pioneering researcher
on the physiology of diving (following his father, who was the one who
worked out the phenomenon of the "bends").  He was also a major scientific
popularizer and generally outrageous character.
