<body><P><h1>Douglas Falconer</h1><P>
Empirical quantitative geneticist who did major work on long-term
selection response in mouse body weight.  He was the author of the
highly influential text <em>An Introduction to Quantitative Genetics</em> (1960
and later editions, down to this day).  Also an extraordinarily nice person.
