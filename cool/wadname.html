<body><P><h1>Conrad Waddington</h1><P>
"Wad" was an influential figure in evolutionary genetics and developmental
genetics.  He is best known as the one who invented the concept of
biological "canalization", coined the term "epigenetics" and discovered the
Mendelian genetic explanation for the phenomenon of genetic assimilation.
He was Professor of Genetics at the University of Edinburgh and head of
the Institute for Animal Genetics there.  He was influential in helping
found the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).  One of his most
widely-cited books is <em>The Strategy of the Genes</em>.  His book
<em>The Evolution of an Evolutionist</em> reprints many of his important
papers and has some autobiographical material.

Did you know: he wrote a book on the use of operations research against
U-boats in World War II (he had headed a group doing that, and recruited
Alan Robertson to his department after having him in that group)?
