<b>Narrator</b>: ROMMY is a postdoc who recently graduated from a well known
American University. He's entered one of Canada's cutting-edge molecular
evolution labs and started his research project on the phylogenetic
relationships of amphibians using several molecular methods. He has become
disillusioned. He just can't handle nine months of winter, real beer -- or Don
Cherry. And they won't even let him bring his pistols into the country! In the
lab he can't seem to do anything right. His postdoc sponsor insists that he
gather his own data instead of buying them, and she has become quite frustrated
with ROMMY's allegiance to the old ways and his former supervisor. Worst of
all, the analysis he's been haphazardly working on is nearly finished, and now
he must confront his "rabid mad-dog cladist" sponsor, and a new philosophy of
data analysis. ROMMY's maximum-likelihood analyses are in strong conflict with
what is being required of him. And knowing nothing (or next to it) about the
philosophy of systematics, ROMMY sets out to interpret or analyze his results
-- and stay out of his sponsor's hair.<p>

Dr. Bogart:  So I hear you've got a new postdoc. How's it going, eh?<p>
<p>
<i>(off-stage the sound of "Yee ha!", followed by an explosion and the sound of
shattering glass)</i><p>

Sponsor:  Does that answer your question?  You know if I didn't know better,
I'd swear he was a deaf, dumb and blind cowboy.<p>

<i>(off-stage Rommy sings "<a href = "rommylyrics.html#sweet">She's the sweetest</a> little cladist that I ever knew,
her mind is quite amazing, and her body looks good too. . .)</i><p>
<p>
Dr. Bogart:  Is that for real?<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  You could not conceive....<p>
<p>
<i>(Rommy, wearing a cowboy hat, stumbles on-stage and drops a small
bottle)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Rommy:  Excuse me Ma'am, but we're almost out of isot . . . oops! <i>(both
profs jump up and off to one side) </i>Aw -- I don't understand why we can't
just send samples out for analysis like I used to?<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Rommy -- you incredulous <i>Chretien</i>! Uh, I mean cretin! I told
you <i>never</i> to carry an uncapped bottle of isotopes -- didn't you hear me?
Can't you hear me? Now clean this mess up right now!<p>

<p>
Rommy:  Aw, Isotopes <i>(Cliff jumps to the side)</i>  -- what's it all about
anyway?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Yeah, I know what you mean. There was another graduate student here
about 10 years ago -- also studying molecular systematics. It was just too much
for him, eh.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Really?<p>
<p>

<b>LIGHTS</b>:  Stage lights up<p>
<p>
Rommy: Yeah Cliff, I can relate to that. I've screwed up everything I've done
today.  This lab work's really getting to me.  Yesterday, I broke the $1400
thermo-plate on my sponsor's <i>p-r-e-c-i-o-u-s</i> automated sequencer. It's
especially bad because when I came here I told her I knew everything I needed
to know!  But I just can't seem to get the techniques wired.  She's even making
me do protein <i>(stutters)</i>  electroph-ph-phoresis to get some cheap
nuclear genes!<p>
<p>
Cliff:  <i>(laughing)</i> Electrophoresis? That's like going back to
kindergarten, eh?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Yeah, except I'm failing.<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Rommy, the time has come for you to meet a friend of mine.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Who's that, huh?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Rommy, that's "Who's that, <cite>eh</cite>?" (<i>replaces his cowboy
hat with a toque</i>) You better get with the language program around here or
nobody's gonna understand you.<p>
<p>
Rommy: Oh yeah. So who is it <i>(pause--adjusts toque)</i> -- eh?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Someone who can straighten you out on electrophoresis once and for
all.<p>
<p>
<i>(they start walking towards the door)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Rommy:  Awright! But who is it?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  You'll see.<p>
<p>
<i>(they come to a door which Cliff knocks on)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Cliff:  Rommy, I want you to meet Dr. C. K. Locus.  They say he's a wizard!<p>
<p>
Rommy:  (<i>gasp</i>) You don't mean, <i>the</i> Dr. Locus?<p>

Rommy:  Hi, Dr. Phenetico.  How's it goin', (<i>small pause</i>) eh?<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Fine, Rommy, and how about you?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well I've finally finished fiddling about with my data gathering and I
guess it's time for the analysis, eh?<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Analysis!  Why there's nothing to it.  Just plug your data into
the MEGA distance analysis computer program.  It gives you a clustered matrix
using a bunch of different methods.  It's easy.  Here, come with me and I'll
show you.<p>

<b>SOUND EFFECT</b>: Computer game noises<p>

Sponsor:  <i>(Hunched over joystick at computer, lots of computer game sounds,
a beer in hand, voice rising in orgasmic crescendo</i>) Fifty thousand,
fifty-five thousand, sixty thousand -- oh, heavens -- oh, oh <i>(hears
knock)</i> . . . oh pooh! <i>(disappointed and sighing)</i>  The door is open.
You may come in <i>(stashes beer can).</i><p>
<p>
Rommy:  How's it goin', eh?  Have ya'll got a minute?  I know you're r-e-a-l
busy with research, and editin' manuscripts, and writin' research grant
applications, and committee....<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(cuts Rommy off -- sharply)</i>  Yes, yes, Rommy.  By the way,
although I find this altogether quite difficult to comprehend, I've
<i>actually</i> heard some encouraging things about your lab work from your
<i>(said with obvious</i> <i>desire)</i> <i>amusing</i> little friend ... you
know, the fellow who's always got a guitar on his back.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  <i>(beaming) </i>Why thanks ma'am. I've finished gathering all them
data <i>(shakes paper pile in hands)</i>  and I've done the alignments too.  I
resolved 4,837 bp and 72 protein loci from all populations -- well, except for
Washington - ever(y)thin' from that place seemed to be dead! <p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Yes, well that's marginally impressive I suppose, <i>(launches into a
meandering reminiscence.  Rommy shifts from one foot to the other) .</i>but I
recall my own industrious postdoctoral days in Bob Murphy's lab -- we
<i>had</i> to collect a minimum of <i>10,000 base pairs</i> and whenever I'd
ask how many protein loci were appropriate he'd simply say "one more than Don
Buth's latest paper...<p>
<p>
Rommy:  <i>(interjecting)</i>  Uh, ma'am -- I've already analyzed the data
too.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(sarcastically)</i> Oh goody!  Perhaps you can get at least this
right?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, I've been doin' a lot of reading, especially in Systematic
Biology, and in Evolution, and I talked to Dr. Phenetico. <i>(puts paper on
desk and points to something on it)</i> Here's the matrices of Kimura's
2-parameter distance values for the sequence data and Nei's D's for the
proteins. <i>(Rommy pauses for breath, music starts -- intro to NO D!)</i>'
I've clustered them a bunch of different ways, like UPGMA and neighbor-joining,
using MEGA. It seems to give pretty good results. Look, the trees are similar
and . . .<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(slams high-heeled shoe on desk stopping Rommy, then shrieks)</i>
Rommy! ... How many times do I have to tell you about distance data?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Tell me what?<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(stands and gestures)</i>  Look you insufferable moron, everybody
knows! <p>

<b> LIGHTS</b>:  Stage lights up<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Sorry ma'am, but I reckon the difference between cladistics and
phenetics is just a euclidean versus Manhattan distance matrix.  That's what my
Ph.D. supervisor taught me and he oughta know -- `cause he <i>says</i> he's a
cladist!<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(gets really excited, comes out from behind desk with journal in
hand, and backs Rommy through door and across stage toward slide screen)
</i>Listen Einstein, your prof was <i>wrong</i>!  Phenetics is only about
overall similarity. It has nothing to do with euclidean vs. Manhattan distance
matrices. You're as confused as the fools in this new journal issue (<i>waves
it in Rommy's face</i>). They think you can use frequency data to reconstruct a
phylogeny. Ha!<p>
<p>
Rommy:  And what's wrong with that?<p>
<p>
<b>SLIDES</b>:  slide A<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Well, in the first place, look at the assumptions. Consider this
(<i>gesture to slide screen</i>), at mutation a gene is at its lowest
frequency, and it may increase in frequency through time until fixation.  Now
evolve some taxa.  Voila, you get a character state tree that reflects
evolution.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  (arrogant) Yea, exactly!<p>
<p>
<b>SLIDES</b>:  slide B<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Exactly my derriere! You just swallowed the bait, <i>fishlips</i>. At
each clagogenic event one taxon must stop evolving. (<i>gesture to slide
screen</i>). In this case, A goes to fixation, B decreases in frequency, and so
forth. And the resultant character-state tree does <i>not</i> reflect
genealogical relationships. Besides, the character state trees can <i>only</i>
be pectinate in shape -- A can never have B as a sister taxon! I could go on,
<i>Doctor</i> Rommy.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  (<i>sarcastic</i>) Whatever ya'll! Ya know, where I come from, we just
call these concerns <i>cladobabble</i> <i>(grins stupidly)</i>.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(super irritated, practically screeching)</i>  <i>Cladobabble</i>?
Don't get me started!  Look you (<i>pause</i>) half-witted hayseed, if it's
just cladobabble, tell me why the pseudocladistic FREQPARS evaluation is
typically the same as a UPGMA (<i>yelling</i>) <i>phenogram</i>, whereas coding
for mutation events only gives you congruence with a really good, independent
osteological analysis?<p>
<p>
<b>SLIDES</b>: (<i>Hybognathus</i> example on-screen.)<p>
<p>
Rommy:  They're just different trees -- that's all. Don't mean one's righter.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Go read Popper. It's called independent corroboration. Just look at
these fish data -- well, okay so they're just fish data -- but come on, tell me
they're just different trees, and one's not (<i>with Texas accent</i>)
<i>righter</i>!  And before you say anything about this just being one case,
<i>Doctor</i> Rommy, lay your money down, boy, and we'll do it data set by data
set, corroboration by corroboration. But only if you <i>really</i> want to get
me started?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  <i>(indignant, storms towards the door -- tosses paper into trash, then
whirls around)</i> Looks like I don't <i>need</i> to get you started! You're so
blinded by your own vision of this cladistics stuff that ya'll can't see
nothin' else! <p>

<b>SCENE 5</b>:  Rommy meets Cliff<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Hey Rommy, so how's it goin', eh?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Not so good, Cliff.  I thought lab work was tough but now I gotta
analyze my data <i>(gestures with paper pile in his hands)</i> like that
mad-dog bi-bi.... cladist wants me too -- <i>(sarcastically)</i> <i>her</i>
version of cladistics...<i>(then does a tonal 180 and looks
thoughtful/worried)</i> ........hey, uh CCCliff? <p>
<p>
Cliff:  Yeah?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  What all is <i>her</i> version of cladistics anyway?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Cladistics is simple -- in theory.  You reconstruct phylogenetic
relationships based on shared derived character states, and not overall
similarity.  There are a number of ways to analyze data but only one is
genealogical.  Look...<p>

Rommy:  Hot dang, I think I see what ya'll's gettin' at.  A phenogram and a

analysis and expect to resolve relationships and reconstruct phylogenies.
Different methods have different assumptions, and shared <i>derived</i> states
ain't the same as overall similarity. <i>(throws paper in garbage)</i><p>
 <p>
Cliff:  Exactly. But of course, it's all in Willi Hennig's book.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Oh Yeah? Who was he, eh?<p>

<p>
Dr. Phenetico: <i> (enters)</i>  Hi, boys.<p>
<p>
Rommy and Cliff:  Hi, Dr. Phenetico.  How's it goin', eh?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  I was just telling Rommy about cladistics, parsimony and character and
state analyses.<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Oh, that's easy. It's all <i>garbage</i> -- but it's easy.
Parsimony? Just what type of parsimony do you want? And who said evolution
occurs in a most parsimonious manner? Besides, what's the <i>real
</i>likelihood of finding the true tree anyway?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Yeah, that sounds great, eh Cliff?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  I don't know. <i> (looks thoughtful)</i> Dr. Phenetico, isn't maximum
parsimony just the least problematic method of data analysis because it has a
refutationist philosophy and isn't based on neo-justificationism? Your approach
just doesn't sound right to me.<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Naw, philosophy isn't important. It's easier to justify how
your <i>estimating</i> the truth, than to waste time trying to explain the
data.  Besides, enter the new millennium wand use neighbor-joining and maximum
likelihood methods.<p>
<p>
Cliff:  <i>(more analytically)</i> So let me get this. You want to predict the
<i>frequency</i> of an evolutionary event occurring. Hmmmm. But there's only
one truth in an actual phylogeny.  And you'd prefer to justify your phylogeny
regardless of whether it's true or not, instead of just explaining your
data?<i> (Grunt.s)</i> <p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico: Uh . . . Well, something like that. Why are you worried about
assumptions anyway?  All you need is an analysis so you can make predictions
from your data. The predictions are the important thing. Assumptions are just
trivial <i>bullshit</i>.  Besides, Rommy, if you follow my advice, you'll get
fewer trees.<p>
<p>
<i>(Dr. Phenetico leaves)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Cliff:  <i>(calling after him)</i>  But I still think that philosophy is
important.<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  <i>(over his shoulder)</i> Aw, you're just pissin' into the
wind.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  But what if it works, Cliff?  I read that you should calculate the
likelihood of a tree being true -- ya know, like using bootstrap values. And
like Dr. Phenetico said, you also get <i>fewer</i> trees.  That sounds good to
me.<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Rommy, you may get fewer trees simply because the computer program is
written that way; it can only give one answer.  <p>
<p>
Rommy:  Oh. <i>(pauses)</i> But what if it works? You don't think all these
people can be wrong, do you? It just sounds like more of that
<i>cladobbabble</i> stuff again.<p>

that's truly wonderful Rommy.  It only took you <i>two months</i> to finally
execute a parsimony analysis. And by the way, the proper analogy would be

Sponsor:  <i>(exasperated)</i> Listen you slowpoke cowpoke, like I have
painstakingly explained to you on occasions too frequent to enumerate, the
entire approach to distance analyses -- including maximum likelihood -- is
philosophically flawed, especially when it comes to sequence data, which can
only change in certain, predetermined directions.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Oh.<p>

Sponsor:  So you see, you <i>always</i> have to think <i>(points to head).</i>
And just when you think you have it figured out, step back and question your
own conclusions. It's okay to make mistakes -- but it's as wrong as wrong can
be to be pig-headed and defensive about previous ideas.<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Awright.  I think I understand.  I'll go and re-analyze my data right
now.  Gee, I really appreciate the help.  Yeah, a Ph.D. is a doctor of
philosophy degree. Philosophy is important. Without a sound philosophy,
analyses are just a waste of paper. <i>(drops paper in garbage)</i> Thanks
ya'll.  <i>(Rommy leaves saying...)</i> a Ph.D. is a doctor of
<i>philosophy</i>.<p>

<b>Narrator</b>:  Rommy spends weeks checking his sequence alignments and
evaluating them using maximum parsimony.  He re-codes his allozyme data and
re-calculates his trees.  Then it's back to his sponsor's office.<p>

<i>(Nasty kill computer game sounds again.</i> <i>Rommy knocks on door)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Sponsor: <i>(Uncharacteristically affable) </i>You may come in.  <i>(Rommy
enters carrying computer output)</i> Young Rommy -- I haven't seen you for
weeks!  <i>(Prof turns to audience)</i> And they have perhaps been the best
weeks of my life! <i>(Prof turns to Rommy)</i> Wherever have you been?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, I've been slapping my ol' Mac . . . computer that is.  But I'm
beginnin' to understand how to do cladistics properly.  You know, I got a
different set of trees with a much higher consistency index! <i>And</i> get
this ya'll, the allozyme and sequence trees were congruent for once!<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(haughty laugh)</i> I'm not too surprised that your data show
greater consistency.  How did you code your allozyme data this time?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well ma'am, I found this obscure paper describing something called
"mutation coding" which equates mutation events with synapomorphies.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  And philosophically?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, I agree that character states must be heritable, and that derived
states be obtained from mutations, so I guess I agree. But the funny thing is,
the paper isn't even acknowledged in the data analysis chapter of my Molecular
Systematics textbook. I guess they just didn't know about it.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(coughs into hand and rolls eyes)</i> Rommy, your persistent
naivet&eacute; about the politics of systematics is quaint but stunning. You
have much to learn my green little grasshopper -- but never mind that now. How
many trees <i>did</i> you find?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, PAUP found three equally parsimonious allozyme trees, but one was
identical to the sequence tree. <p>
<p>
Sponsor: That's most efficient Rommy -- not to mention fortuitous. So, have we
a manuscript?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Right, uh, yeah. A manuscript. Now all I have to do is get the analysis
past the reviewers. Okay, a draft will be on your desk next week.<p>
<p>
<i>(Rommy leaves office, stands around near door reading something; Dr.
Phenetico approaches)</i><p>
<p>
Rommy: Oh, hi Dr. Phenetico.  How's it goin' eh?<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Just fine, Rommy.  And with you?<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, my sponsor finally liked my last analysis -- parsimony with no
frequency justification.<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Aww -- I don't know why you're wasting your time with this
character and state crap anyway, frequencies are phylogenetically informative
for allozymes, and you <i>need</i> to use maximum likelihood on sequence data.
<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Well, I disagree with ya'll.  I've decided to base my analysis on a
defensible philosophy of science.  <p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico:  Philosophy! This is all very disappointing, because I've been
very patient with you and even come to your defense when others were
complaining about you. Look, Rommy, the rules are all written here <i>(shows a
ceramic tablet that looks like the ten commandments)</i>.<p>
<p>
	Oh, sure you can go and "preach to the choir" in a journal like Cladistics.
But then you've written off the vast majority of progressive, forward-thinking
theoretical systematists in favor of appealing to a small, reactionary right
wing of cladism.  There are only a handful of places left where these people
thrive, and if you persist in this way of thinking, those places will be your
<i>only</i> option for permanent employment!<p>
<p>
	I'm giving up on you scientifically. I can't waste time arguing philosophy
with people who can't think and behave rationally. <p>
Rommy:  Oh, so I have to follow <i>you</i> to be rational and correct? Even to
get a job? Whatever happened to academic freedom?  If you can't handle the heat
of philosophy Dr. Phenetico, then get the hell out of the theoretical kitchen.
You've done nothing but cause me trouble! I think the basic premise of
cladistics makes more sense for recovering genealogies than some mumbo-jumbo
fancy-dancy model. Some of what you say makes sense too, but since ya'll won't
even have a discussion about it, I think you're the one who's lost!<p>
<p>
Dr. Phenetico: But the rules are all written in stone!<p>
<p>
<i>(Phenetico brandishes tablet again, Rommy grabs it and smashes it on the
floor)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Rommy: Now it looks like I'm one of them "rabid mad dog cladists" too --
grrrrrrrrrr <i>(Dr. Phenetico starts backing away)</i>, and damn proud of it.
I'm not playing no political fool's game just to get me a job.  And I don't
understand why we all have to fight about it either. And speakin' of
right-wing, ya'll turn everything into an "us against them" argument -- what
are ya, some kind of Washington Republican? Well I'm gonna bite your sorry
self-righteous ass! Grrrrr grrrrrrr grrrrrrr grrrrr...<p>
<p>

Phenetico off the stage growling; Phenetico fends him off with staff.  Someone

opened and handed to him from various quarters)</i> It might be ten years since
we first did Rommy but some things haven't changed -- you still can't take a
cladist anywhere.  Anyway, Rommy works with his data and eventually prepares a
manuscript.<p>

<b>SCENE 9</b>:  Enter Sponsor and Cliff chatting.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  . . . Yes, well of course I have no time for the triviality of
something as puerile as Melrose Place, but I do enjoy having the television in
the bedroom nonetheless. Besides, that was wonderful last night -- wasn't it?<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Yeah, what a game.  Wow! The fights were great, eh? Especially the one
between the referees.  And that poor goalie, he sure got pulverized . . . and
the coach got fired again!<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  <i>(sighing dreamily, clearly thinking of something completely
different)</i> Yes, yes, I do so enjoy these passionate displays of unbridled
testosterone . . . <i>(Rommy starts entering, then Cliff coughs, and Sponsor
catches herself</i>) Um, oh, the <i>hockey game</i>, uh, yes, it was certainly
a <i>physical</i> one all right.  And, uh, I thought being a cladist was
difficult!<p>
<p>
Rommy:  Hey, how's it goin' eh?  <p>
<p>
Sponsor: Hello, Rommy.<p>
<p>
Cliff: Hi, Rommy<p>
<p>
<i>(all three open beers and hand them to each other)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><b>SOUND EFFECT</b>: Beer cans opening<p>
<p>
Rommy: Well, I've finished the manuscript. I decided against a total evidence
approach because each allozyme locus is the functional equivalent of each of
the seven genes I sequenced. Anyway, all nodes are supported by good
synapomorphic states. I suppose ya'll want to be authors on the paper too?<p>
<p>
Sponsor and Cliff:  No not really.  <p>
<p>
Rommy:  Oh...<p>
<p>
Cliff:  Listen Rommy, the data gathering was all yours, and so was the analysis
and writing.  I couldn't justify being an author.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  This is just fantastic, Rommy.  I'm almost speechless. I couldn't be
prouder, and since I didn't do anything other than provide the appropriate
guidance, you can leave me off as well. I'm just glad that you've
<i>finally</i> learned to think for yourself.  No more black-box analyses, eh?
I mean, right? <p>
<p>
<i>(music starts)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Rommy:  Yeah, I've learned to always look at the assumptions, and to consider
the underlying philosophy more seriously.<p>
<p>
Sponsor:  Oh <i>(clasping hands)</i> I'm just delighted! You realize, of
course, that soon you'll be finished here and your <i>own</i> students will be
listening to you......<p>

<b>ROMMY</b>:  This <i>isn't</i> where it ends. What's the use of having
students if all we pass on are our bad habits and petty squabbling. Systematics
and philosophy are all well and good but what have they really got to do with
anything in the big picture? We're acting like a bunch of bad little kids in
the same sandbox throwing sand in each other's eyes. And at the same time this
is going on, we're losing everything that matters to life because we can't work
together.<p>

Dr. Phenetico: You know Rommy, I've been thinking about what you said the other
day and you're right. We can't have meaningful discussions when we're all so
polarized in our beliefs -- and  perhaps there <i>is</i> a role for philosophy
and assumptions. But more importantly I agree that all our theorizing takes
place in the bubble we call academics, and that there <i>are</i> more serious
things to worry about. Maybe if we were more concerned about life and the fate
of the earth, our philosophical differences wouldn't be such a
problem<i>..</i>..Lets go have a beer and get to know one another.
<i>(Phenetico and Rommy exit with arms around each other)</i>.<p>

Rommy:  Uh, Dr. Phenetico, do we'll have to have that strong Canadian beer
again? Can't I have a Coors Light this time?<p>
