<P>

Lush was the major figure in adapting the quantitative
genetics of Fisher and Wright to animal breeding; his <em>Animal
Breeding Plans</em>, first published in 1937, was the bible of a generation
of quantitative-genetics-oriented animal breeders. (<a
href="https://archive.org/details/animalbreedingpl032391mbp">Here</a> it is
in a free download of a scan of the 1943 edition).

This is not that book, but a 1994 printing of Lush's unpublished mimeographed
notes on theoretical quantitative genetics, which he
wrote in 1948.  They were used in his advanced courses and widely circulated
among animal breeders.  He never put them in book form before his
death in 1982.  In 1994 they were edited for publication by A. B. Chapman
and Robert R. Shrode, with a postscript by James F. Crow.  It is likely that
Lush's failure to publish was because he was intimidated by the arrival in his
university of the opinionated and outspoken
<a href="http://www.amstat.org/about/statisticiansinhistory/index.cfm?fuseaction=biosinfo&BioID=8">Oscar
Kempthorne</a>, who insisted on
a standard of mathematical rigor that Lush was unaccustomed to.

The first part of Section 25.6, on pages 633-634 of Lush's book says:<br>

<blockquote>

<H2>25.6 Evolutionary Aspects of Family Structure</H2>
</DIV>

The distinctness of family differences appears to have been important in the
evolution of those species which are so organized socially that members of
the same family help each other in feeding, in defense, in rearing the
young, and in competition with other families.  Bees, ants, and termites
are conspicuous examples, but some of this occurs in many other species.
Parental care for the young, even to the point of some self-sacrifice,
is almost universal among birds and mammals.  Man often cooperates with his
relatives and neighbors, as well as competing with them.  He does this
to a rather extreme degree in human societies organized in clans or small
tribes which are based on a "blood tie".
<P>
The competition and selection among families thus introduced could make
selection favor any genes which tend to cause their possessor to sacrifice
himself for his deme, provided the sacrifice promotes the biological
welfare of his relatives (some of whom will have some of the gene he has)
enough to more than compensate for the genes lost in his own sacrifice.
This may have had much to do with making qualities of altruism, self-sacrifice,
patriotism, tribal loyalty, cooperativeness, etc., as abundant as they
generally are in human societies which have a strong tribal, clan, or
blood-tie basis, or which have departed from that basis only in the last few
centuries.
<P>
The balance here is intricate, depending on how extreme the self-sacrifice,
at what stage of the life cycle it occurs, how much this increases the
biological success of the benefactor's relatives, how closely these are
related to the benefactor, etc.  The balance depends primarily on whether the
greater biological success of the relatives will multiply the genes
for altruism more than enough to compensate for the loss of those genes in
the individual which sacrificed itself to gain some good for its deme.
Formulas for expressing this quantitatively have barely begun to be explored.

<P>
Notice that he gets close to Hamilton's result ... "close but
no cigar".  Instead of summarizing the benefit to the relatives by an
inclusive fitness change, and calling that <i>b</i> he first wants to
know all the biological details of how the benefit works.  He does not
realize the utility of summarizing this by a single quantity, and that the
resulting formula would be illuminating.
<P>
It becomes less surprising that Lush had this insight so early, when one
considers that he wrote the pioneering papers on family selection in
quantitative genetics, and was quite concerned with the effectiveness of
selection of individuals based on measurements of their relatives.
