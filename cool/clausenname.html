<body><P><h1>Jens Clausen</h1><P>
Clausen, Keck, and Hiesey, of the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University,
did a famous study of
the genetic differentiation of the yarrow <em>Achillea</em> in the Sierra Nevada.
This included the first use of "common garden" experiments to show that
the geographic differentiation of form in this species was genetic.
<P>
Did you know: Hiesey's daughter is much more famous than he was? (She is the
Princeton University religious historian Elaine Pagels, author of
<em>The Gnostic Gospels</em>)
