<body><P><h1>R. A. Fisher</h1><P>
The great founding figure of modern mathematical statistics (likelihood,
consistency, efficiency, sufficiency, analysis of variance, etc. etc.), he was
also one of the two greatest of the three founders of theoretical population
genetics (and thus of the modern evolutionary synthesis).  His 1918 paper in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh
established modern quantitative genetics theory.  His book <em>The Genetical
Theory of Natural Selection</em> has continued to be mined for insights.
