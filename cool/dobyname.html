<body><P><h1>Theodosius Dobzhansky</h1><P>
The predominant and pioneering empirical evolutionary geneticist,
his book <em>Genetics
and the Origin of Species</em> (1937 and later editions) was the
first and most influential of the major expositions of the Modern
Evolutionary Synthesis.  He was the first advocate of the Biological
Species Concept, and the major advocate of the position that genetic
polymorphism would prove to be largely maintained by balancing selection.
