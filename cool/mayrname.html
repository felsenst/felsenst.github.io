<body><P><h1>Ernst Mayr</h1><P>
Avian systematist whose <em>Systematics and the Origin of Species</em> (1940) was one
of the five great expositions of the Modern Evolutionary Synthesis (the others
being by Dobzhansky, Huxley, Simpson, and Stebbins).  His <em>Animal Species
and Evolution</em> (1963) was influential in arguing the case for the
central importance of allopatric mechanisms of speciation.
Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson and he were the chief propounders
of the biological
species concept and Mayr and Simpson were the
leaders of the "evolutionary systematics" school of classification.
<P>
He had what may delicately be called a "dialectical" relationship
with theoretical population geneticists, but ultimately conceded
that theoreticians did make a major contribution to the founding of the
Neodarwinian Synthesis.  He died in February 2005 at the age of 100.
