<b>Overture</b>
(Tune: "Overture", Tommy, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

    Our boy Rommy
    Went to school
    Got a degree
    An honors in biology
    
    Finished it up
    In no time flat
    Thought a PhD
    Was where it's at

    Now it's a postdoc little Rommy

    At Guelph! At Guelph!

    She's the sweetest little cladist
    That you ever knew.
    Her mind is quite amazing 
    And her body looks good too...

(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

    Rommy can you hear me?
    Will I ever get through?
    Romy can you see me?
    How'm I gonna reach you?
    Ooh ooh ooh Rommy, Rommy, Rommy, Rommy

<b>What's it all about?
(graduate student's lament)</b>
(Song: Ross MacCulloch)

    Sometimes I can't help wonder
    Am I making a great big blunder?
    Is academics the life for me?
    Will I ever get a Ph.D. and a job?
    (I need a job)
    
    I'm afraid that I won't get it right
    In spite of working every night
    Maybe I don't have the insight
    Anxiety has got me so tight I can't sleep
    (I need to sleep)
    
    I've got no one to calm my fears
    Haven't been on a date in years
    None of my data makes any sense
    Am I dumb, or just too dense to understand?
    (I need to understand)
    
    In the lab           make a mess
    In a hurry           never rest
    Running gels         all day long
    Always seem          to get it wrong
    So I go              to see the prof
    Late again           get told off
    Lunch time comes     forget to eat
    Read a journal       fall asleep
    Everybody's          on my back
    All this pressure    I can't hack
    Get to bed           at 4.00 am
    Six o'clock          I'm up again
    
    Maybe I should quit this old school
    Nine to five like other people do
    Go to work, my Uncle Harry says
    I could get a job with good pay, at the bank
    You know I've almost finished my run
    Maybe I'll have time to sleep when it's done
    (Time to sleep when it's done
    
    What's it all about?
    What's it all about?
    What's it all about?

<b>Starch Gel Wizard</b>
(Tune: "Pinball Wizard," Tommy, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

Ever since I was an undergrad 
    I've cooked my own starch gels,
    Poulik, Clayton-Tretiak 
    And Tris-Citrate as well.
    It's ruined all my clothing
    And killed my sense of smell.
    But that electrophoretic whiz-kid 
    Sure cooks a mean starch gel.
    
    He stands like a statue 
    And he works like a machine.
    Pouring out the molds 
    And mixing in between.
    Juggling 20 power packs 
    And buffer trays as well.
    That electrophoretic whiz-kid 
    Sure cooks a mean starch gel.
    
    He's a starch gel wizard
    With his Erlenmeyer flask.
    A starch gel wizard!
    It's not an easy task!
    
    How do you think he does it?  I don't know!
    What makes him so good?
    
    Always gets the first run.
    On the balance he's really quick.
    Pulls five slices off at once.
    He knows all the tricks.
    I stand in awe to see
    These methods he knows so swell.
    That electrophoretic whiz-kid 
    Sure cooks a mean starch gel.
    
    I thought I knew
    How to stain a slice.
    But for esterase
    I had to ask his advice.
    
    Even with my favorite enzyme 
    His resolution's better.
    He cranks out 50 slices 
    While I trash another sweater.
    He never spills a drop. 
    He's tidier than hell.
    That electrophoretic whiz-kid 
    Sure cooks a mean starch gel.

<b>DO YOU THINK IT'S ALL RIGHT!</b>
(Tune: "Do You Think It's All Right!," Tommy, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

    Do you think it's all right
    To use these esterase loci?
    Do you think its all right
    There's just a few too many?

<b>WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?</b>
(Lyrics: Ross MacCulloch)

    Got a program here that's just the thing 
    Yeah it can do 'mos anything
    It'll take those data turn 'em any which way
    An' make 'em do whatever you say 

    CHORUS:
    So tell me what, what are you waiting for -- boy?
    What, what are you waiting for?
    Please tell me what, what are you waiting for -- boy?
    Yeah what, what are you waiting for?
    
    There's an option here for every need
    Jus' toggle 'em ON and they'll do the deed
    An' you can shift them ol' results in any direction 
    You know you gotta make 'em fit your preconceptions
    
    CHORUS
    
    Got ambiguous data?  Hell, just ignore 'em 
    Cause this 'ol program eliminates all those problems 
    Yeah, don't let no candy-ass assumptions drag you down
    And shor' as hell don't let no goddamn data push you around!
    
    CHORUS

<b>NO D</b>
(Tune: "I'm Free!," Tommy, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

No D. No D. 
    If a phylogeny is what you want to see.
    No D. No D.
    Character and state data are what you need.
    
    If I told you what it takes to make the shortest tree
    You'd laugh and say "nothing's that simple"
    But you've been told many times before
    Phenetic trees are nothing more
    Than just a way to say that things are similar.
    
    No D. No D.
    Character and state data are what you need.
    No D. No D.
    If a phylogeny is what you want to see.

<b>Addicted to Clades</b>
(Tune: "Addicted to Love," Rip Tide, Robert Palmer)
(Lyrics: Bob Murphy/Leslie Lowcock)

    The lights are on, but you're not home
    Philosophy, is not your own
    Your pencil breaks, your body shakes;
    Another character is all it takes
    You can't sleep, you can't eat;
    There's no doubt — you're in it deep
    Computer's old. It's just too slow.
    Another Mac is all you neeeeeeeed.
    You like to think you're immune to this stuff — oh yeah?
    It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
    You know you're gonna have to face it; 
    You're addicted to clades.
    
    You see the signs, but you can't read.
    You're running at, a different speed.
    Your heart beats in double time;
    Another cladogram and you'll be mine.
    A one track mind; you can't be saved;
    Cladistics is all you crave.
    If there's some data left for you,
    You don't mind if you do.
    You like to think you're immune to this stuff — oh yeah?
    It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
    You know you're gonna have to face it; 
    You're addicted to clades.
    
    Might as well face it you're addicted to clades 
    
    The lights are on, but you're not home
    Your philosophy is not your own.
    Your pencil breaks, your teeth grind,
    Another cladogram will do just fine.
    You like to think you're immune to this stuff — oh yeah?
    It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough
    You know you're gonna have to fact it;
    You're addicted to clades
    
    Might as well face it you're addicted to clades

<b>ONE OF THESE THINGS</b>
(Tune:  "One of these things," Sesame Street)

    One of these things is not like the other.
    One of these things just doesn't belong.
    Can you guess which thing is not like the other
    Before I finish this song?
    

<a name = "superstar">
<b>WILLI HENNIG SUPERSTAR</b>
(Tune: "Jesus Christ Superstar," Andrew Lloyd Weber)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

    Every time I look at you I don't understand.
    How you let the things you did get so out of hand.
    You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned.
    Now why'd you choose such a backward time in such a strange land?
    If you were here today you could have reached the whole nation.
    Translations are much quicker, with all this mass communication.
    
    Don't you get me wrong...
    Only wanna know...
    
    CHORUS:
    Willi Hennig, superstar
    What did you use synapomorphies for?
    Willi Hennig, superstar
    Why'd you create new methods for?
    
    Willi Hennig, superstar
    and all of your followers near and far.
    Willi Hennig, superstar
    Just who the hell do you think you are.
    
    Tell me what you think about the pick of the crop.
    Which of all the cladists would you put at the top?
    Nelson and his patterns?  Is this where it's at?
    Estabrook's compatibility? Now does this show the fact?
    Felsenstein and likelihood, Is this the way to go?
    Farris' Wagner trees?  Is he the head of the show?
    
    Don't get me wrong 
    Only want to know

<b>Clado Babble</b>
(Tune: "My Generation," My Generation, The Who)
(Lyrics: Raoul Bain)

    People try to twist my hand
    Think if they push I'll understand
    Fill their mouths with words from Scrabble
    They're just talking cladobabble
    
    That's cladobabble
    Yeah that's cladobabble, baby
    
    (You're just talkin' cladobabble--x2)
    
    Why don't you all ph-ph-pheneticize? 
    Cause all you ever do is criticize.
    I'm not trying just to rouse some rabble 
    But you keep talking cladobabble
    
    That's cladobabble...
    
    Why do you talk ph-ph-philosophy?
    What's the difference if you get the same tree? 
    Every time I'm high in the saddle
    You buck me off with your cladobabble
    
    That's cladobabble...
    
    People try to think real deep
    Most of that junk puts me to sleep
    But every time I try to dabble
    You climb the Tower of Cladobabble
    
    That's cladobabble.....

<b>LIKE A BEER CAN</b>
(Tune: "Like a Virgin," Like a Virgin, Madonna

<a name = "substitute">
<b>Substitute</b>
(Tune: "Substitute," My Generation, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie A. Lowcock)

    Two strands of DNA go together
    But they don't stay that way forever
    PCR amplifies these helix things 
    Pull them apart and you can read the strings 
    But the simple things you see are all complicated
    Four little letters get you real frustrated -- yeah
    
    Substitute, C for G
    Substitute, A for T
    Substitute, it ain't no fun
    I hope I get this sequence done
    
    I was born with a Gilson pippetteman for a pacifier
    The light strand of my sequence was heavy, and the heavy strand really lighter
    And now you dare to tell me that you blew the extraction 
    Then forgot to add the TAQ that fuels the amp reaction 
    Your radiograph patterns suggest hybridization
    Looks bloody good but it's just contamination. . . yeah
    
    Substitute, 5' for 3
    (Substitute)
    Complimentary strands you see
    (Substitute)
    Doesn't matter what it means
    (Substitute)
    'Cause all you've got there are pseudogenes
    
    Substitute, C for G
    Substitute, A for T
    Substitute, it ain't no fun
    I hope I get this sequence done


<a name = "jungle">
<b>Systematic Jungle</b>
(Song: Ross MacCulloch)

    (pump up the acrimony, pump up the acrimony...)
    
    You read it in the journals, hear it at seminars 
    Derogatory comments, methodology wars
    You hear it over coffee, you hear it over beer
    "That guy's work is bullshit and it shouldn't be published here!"
    
    It's a systematic jungle, it's a systematic jungle, 
    A systematic jungle out there
    
    Why can't we keep it friendly hypothesize and refute? 
    How come it gets so f---ed-up and ends up in dispute? 
    A controversial paper can't get a good review
    And a lineup forms to cut it up in the pages of Points of View
    
    It's a systematic jungle, it's a systematic jungle, 
    A systematic jungle out there
    
    If molecules conflict, with morphology
    Both sides leap up to defend their methodology 
    Journals are established, supporting just one side
    But if all data aren't accepted then can this be justified?
    
    CHORUS:
    It's a systematic jungle out there
    And if you're planning a career 
    Take a word of caution because
    Everybody's watchin' and
    We're telling you you've got to beware 
    
    You know that these meetings, are supposed to be big fun 
    But what goes on inside them, it sure keeps you on the run 
    At every evening social, and in dingy residence halls
    The clash of ideologies echoes off the walls
    
    It's a systematic jungle, it's a systematic jungle, 
    A systematic jungle out there
    
    Opposing schools of thought, meet up once a year
    They teach each other nothing but intimidation and fear 
    Instead of making some attempt at reconciliation
    They train their students in the art of retaliation

<b>LISTENING TO YOU: </b>
(THE WILLI HENNIG REFRAIN)
(Tune:  We're Not Gonna Take It!, Tommy, The Who)
(Lyrics: Leslie Lowcock)

    Working with you
    I learned the starch gel
    And the appropriate lab techniques.
    
    Following you
    I learned to tell
    When data are complete
    
    Right behind you
    I see the methods.
    And in the end I see the tree.
    
    From you
    I find the meaning
    Of true phylogenies.

<b>BEHIND BLUE EYES</b>
(Tune: "Behind Blind Eyes,". Who's Next, The Who)
(Lyrics: Bob Murphy/Leslie Lowcock)

    We all know what it's like, to be the bad man
    To sit and throw sand in each other's eyes 
    We all know what it's like to be hated
    To be fated and blinded by our lies
    
    But my dreams they are as empty
    As my conscience seems to be
    We have hours, maybe only years
    To save the world's biodiversity
    
    How many know what it's like, to watch their child die 
    Like some do, and they blame you
    No one bites back as hard on their anger 
    When they see us acting like we do
    
    And these dreams they seem so empty
    Like our conscience seems to be
    We have little time remaining
    To make a difference, can't you see?
    
    mmmmmm
    
    Find a big tree crack it over
    Plant designer coffee to be cool
    Destroy much needed pharmaceuticals
    Yeah, throw more sand and act like a fool
    
    And when we consume more than we need 
    It means that ignorance is in style
    'Cause we've lose sight of what's important 
    So hold me close let me hug my child
    
    We all know what it's like to be the bad man
    To sit and throw sand in each other's eyes
